The events scheduled for the day were AUTOBOT and ROBORUSH. Every team brought out their best robots to battle it out to qualify for the final round. For every team, their brute strength and feline reflexes were the keys to their success. Here are a few glimpses of the event to bring forth an ambiance of zest, exuberance, and enthusiasm.",

      "body": "A new nightmare for windows users, PrintNightmare\r\nOn July 1st,\\u00a0 the security research at Microsoft uncovered a new vulnerability, the PrintNightmare. It seems as if the security analysts accidentally unveiled it before Microsoft could convey a fix. Though later they acknowledged that Microsoft had viably fixed the issue.\\u00a0\r\n\r\nMicrosoft labeled the vulnerability as CVE-2021-34527, suggesting to be aware of the vulnerability and working on a patch. Microsoft has not disclosed the severity of this vulnerability, as it claims to be investigating more into this.\r\n\r\nSo how does PrintNightmare impacts us?\r\nPrintNightmare impacts the Windows Print Spooler, which handles imprinting on Windows PCs.\\u00a0 The Print Spooler had also accomplished notoriety 10 years prior when it was utilized by a still-anonymous entity to obliterate nuclear centrifuges, that were being utilized by Iran to handle nuclear fuel. The PrintNightmare is portrayed as zero-day since it offers PC administrators no possibility for detection and hence no ideal opportunity to react.\\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt can not only cause an accursed person to get access into our PC and become an admin, but the scarier aspect of this entire circumstance is far-off code execution, which can be weaponized by lawbreakers. It takes into account both nearby access and sidelong development into different frameworks like a domain controller. Domain controllers are influenced if the print spooler service is empowered. The Authenticated Users bunch is nested within the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access which is raised and makes domain controllers vulnerable in default organizations.\\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll forms of Windows contain this vulnerable code and are helpless. Your system might also be at risk if Point and Print is enabled in your system or the Authenticated Users group is nested and settled inside any of the groups that are listed in the mitigation section.\r\n\r\nWhile everyone awaits Microsoft's release to fix this issue, it is encouraged to impair the Print Spooler for the time being. To be on the safer side, you can either disable the Print Spooler service or disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy. Microsoft strongly recommends installing the June 8, 2021 security updates as all versions of Windows are vulnerable.",

The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender congruence. International Women\\u2019s Day is all about unity, celebration, reflection, advocacy and action. Globally, purple is a colour for symbolizing women. Historically the combination of purple, green and white was used to symbolize the qualities of a woman which originated from the Women\\u2019s Social and Political Union in the UK in 1908. Purple signifies justice and dignity, green symbolises hope and white represents purity, but is no longer used due to \\u2018purity\\u2019 being an arguable notion.\r\nWoman \\u2013 the power to mould, nourish and remould. The word \\u2018woman\\u2019 conjures up the image of selfless love, care and affection. At the same time, women ignite the spirit of power and hope. Women, from time immemorial have fought for the rights of others and now it\\u2019s their time to get their rights realized and acquire equal participation in the society. Women are born with the power to save and love and are the collosal reservoir of talent which has yet not been employed.\r\nThe bottom line of celebrating women\\u2019s day is due to widespread differences in various fields-the pay difference of 14.9% between men and women, only 21.4% of seats for women in parliament around the world, lack of awareness for women education and many more. A conventional myth in the society is that issues related to women empowerment can only be addressed at an infinitesimally slower pace. Many people think that gender gap does not really exist and some are also of the belief that the efforts made by individuals cannot actually make any difference. These beliefs over the years have enfeebled the power of women. The first in the endeavor is to eradicate this deep rooted menace and realise that the problem can only be identified and solved by encountering the actual irrational vetoes of the society.\r\nWe are to take more advantage of the potentials and the talents of half of humanity and not just seek to anoint gender equality in principle. We are entering an exciting period of history where the world expects balance. We notice its absence and celebrate its presence. So make a difference, think globally and act locally to develop a balance for better.\r\nThis is a day to celebrate all ladies who have dared to dream big, the diversity and talent that lie within a feminine heart and the courage and determination that prevent every human from crumbling. A little girl with passion is turned into an inspiring woman of tomorrow. Celebrate all women and acknowledge the great things they do and tell every woman close to your heart, how much she means to you.",

With an IQ of 162, which is actually believed to be two points more than that of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawkings her academic file is all fat with degrees even at such a young age. She started with algebra at  an early age of three and graduated from high school by the time she was eight. Presently this wonder girl of ten is pursuing two engineering courses simultaneously in Mexico. One in Systems Engineering at Universidad CNCI and the other in Industrial Engineering with a focus on mathematics at UNITEC.\r\n\r\nBut sadly her childhood was not a bed of roses despite her talent. She was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome , a kind of autism, which makes social interaction difficult at an age of three and hence was often called \"weirdo\" or \"oddball\" by her classmates.\r\n\r\nBut she outshined in her own unique way.

Wondering, what it may be? Well, it's a butterfly.\r\nWhile we were cherubic lads, we were very fond of butterflies. Every one of us had adored the field hunting of butterflies. Even at this point in time, we are left awestruck when we trace them thronging in the full-bloomed chaparrals. They are small but approachable, they flutter around, lurk beneath the bushes, are even perishable, but still add beauty and color to the spaces they touch.\r\nErstwhile we find ourselves cocooned in isolation and despair and are unable to find our way out of the darkness. We think of giving up, but remember that this is similar to the phase a caterpillar goes through and emerge with majestic wings. A butterfly initiates her life as a round, oval egg. A similar phase of our life when we are in our mother's womb. When the egg hatches the larvae turn into caterpillars. For humans, this phase is of nourishing and growing a child to make him stand on his foot. The caterpillars are done growing once they reach their full-length and are now termed as a chrysalis. This impersonates our teenage. After the continuous metamorphosis, a butterfly emerges and spreads her wings to live her life independently alike us when we grow from mere boys into men.\r\nWe fulfill daily plodding-from going to college and meeting deadlines. This is an endless time loop that goes on forever. We can't escape these moments. Moments of values, moments of appreciation. So the next time when we spot a butterfly, we need to look beyond the binaries of an average human spectrum and feel the charm, look for hope, celebration, and transformation as this is what a butterfly symbolizes.",

      "body": "Not every fantasy or fictional books have the ability to draw their readers into their fictional world. The instance lies differently for the Marvel comics. The saga of Marvel superhero movies began when The Marvel Cinematic Universe dropped its first superhero movie IRONMAN in 2008. The film grossed over $585 million. It received praise from critics for its action, screenplay, visual effects, and action sequences. More than a decade after its launch The Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a force to be reckoned with.\r\nOver the past 10 years, The MCU has provided fans with over 21 movies till date each one imgurling with the other. These movies were evenly spread over 3 phase of The MCU timeline collectively known as The Infinity Saga. Last year was the biggest blockbuster for Marvel Studios as the much awaited AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR hit the theatres. This indeed was the biggest project for The Marvel Studios. Made with a budget of $316-400 million this was the most expensive movie ever made. The much-anticipated movie was well received by fans all over the world. It grossed $2.048 billion worldwide. Packed with an incident from the off, it was an onslaught of action, thrills, gags, and gasps, played out with an ensemble so gigantic it leaves all other extended universe crossovers in the dust. This probably wasn\\u2019t the best place for an uninitiated newbie to start. It took the audience to a place most tentpole movies wouldn't dream of. At the end of the movie, most of our popular superheroes were decimated leading their fate in a cliff hanger. Since then fans around the world want to know what the next movie might hold for them.\r\nAVENGERS: ENDGAME the sequel of Avengers(2012), Avengers: Age Of Ultron(2015), and Avengers: Infinity War. Scheduled to release on April 26, 2019, the movie has already made fans go brainsick. Nobody expected that Thanos- a despot of intergalactic infamy, would succeed in his attempt to wipe out half of the universe for the sake of creating a balance amongst all living creatures and resources. We are all eagerly waiting for our dusted characters to come back to life. We are all waiting to see what Dr.Strange saw in his 14000605 outcomes of the battle. This movie will wind up a successful decade for The MCU. Moreover, this might be the last Avengers movie we will come across. Last week Marvel Studios dropped its second official trailer for the much-awaited movie of the year. Since then fans around the world have engrossed themselves in the trailer breakdown and suggesting fan theories. The dialogues \"Some People Move on, but not us\" and \"Whatever it Takes\" by our much-loved heroes including Captain America, Ironman, and Thor went viral after they decided not to move on and rather undo the wrong done to the living beings of the universe. With less than a month in its release, the movie has already set numerous records and has dominated geek conversations for days. We don't know what kind of grief the movie holds for us, we should prepare ourselves to mourn over once Avengers: Endgame hits the theatres and the fate of our heroes finally get settled.",

Wei Shen is a martial arts expert, and that\\u2019s what you would be doing for the majority of\r\nthe game to finish off your enemies. The game has a unique levelling\r\nsystem which involves three different areas of expertise: Triad, Cop and\r\nFace. Levelling each of the areas of expertise gives you access to skills\r\nbased on that area of expertise: rank up your Triad level enough, and\r\nyou won\\u2019t need to trigger alarms to steal cars, rank up your Cop level to\r\nget more access to Police equipment, and the Face level is all aboutyour reputation among the Hong Kong locals. You get access to guns\r\npretty late in the game, but when you do, you get access to many more\r\nskills, such as disarming enemies if you get close enough, Bullet Time\r\nmechanics, and all that shiny stuff. As you progress through the game\r\nyou unlock more and more Martial Arts moves, and by the endgame, you\r\nhave become the superhuman equivalent of Jet Li and Jackie Chan put\r\ntogether. Small spoiler: you should learn the Action Hijack thing, it\\u2019s pretty epic.\r\n\r\nStory: The story involves Wei Shen trying to infiltrate the Triad gangs, but getting more and more involved with them as he rises up the ranks\r\nand gains more reputation. The story is a cheesy one, characteristic of Chinese action movies, and involves a lot of emotional moments. You\r\nfeel more and more attached to the characters in the game. Overall, the story does a good job of keeping you hooked to the game, when coupled\r\nwith the stellar gameplay mechanics.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: A really great gameplay experience along with a good story, for\r\npeople wishing to get into some beat-em-ups and doing some cool tactical takedowns. The difficulty is very balanced, and would give you a sense of achievement without getting cumbersome. A very rewarding experience when you unlock more combos and make your way towards\r\nbecoming the unstoppable martial arts master.",

      "body": "We have often wondered what if cars could read our minds and operate according to the thoughts of the person. Well we don't have to wonder anymore because German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is here to make that dream a reality. At the recent IAA 2021 show in Munich, Germany it unveiled a new version of its AVTR concept car that uses \"Brain Computer Interface\" (BCI) technology to act in accordance to the wishes of its driver. The company's 'Vision AVTR' concept is inspired by the sci-fi movie 'Avatar'. The mock-up transportation's BCI is \"similar to the neuronal connection between the Na'Vi and the nature\".\r\n\r\nThis high-tech car aims to seamlessly merge man and machine, allowing humans to perform \"intuitive interaction\" with the vehicle. Void of the traditional steering wheel system, one has to simply wear electrodes on the head, think about something and it gets done. For example, the technology will allow you to change the music on the vehicle's stereo system without even lifting a finger. Raise a hand, and a menu selection is projected onto the palm of the hand. Users will have this auto-giant wrapped around their little finger.\r\n\r\nBCI technology measures the brain function via a headset as the user focuses on light on the dashboard, it picks the signal and performs certain tasks like temperature control, A/C speed and interior lighting customizations. The first interaction between man and vehicle is completely intuitive. As soon as the driver places his hand on the centre console right next to his seat, the interior comes to life with the help of biometric detection. It can detect the pulse of the people in the car and also sense their breathing. \"The Vision AVTR thus establishes a biometric connection with the driver and increases his awareness of the environment,\" said Mercedes.\r\n\r\nImplementation of BCI technology in cars unravels revolutionary possibilities for intuitive interaction with cars in the future. This concept vehicle is just a stepping stone to the future of mobility, a future where man and technology will coexist in perfect harmony with each other.",

To accomplish this, he began working on the antenna with Adam Montandon in college in 2003, and it has since been improved by Peter Kese and Matias Lizana.\r\nThe Cyborg Antenna is a sensory system that\\u2019s designed to enhance color perception. It is implanted and Osseointegrated in Harbisson's head, protruding from his occipital bone and allowing him to feel and hear color schemes as audible vibrations inside his head, including infrared and ultraviolet, which are undetectable to the naked eye. The antenna also enables internet access and, as a result, color reception from other sensors and satellites. The ability to hear the sound of color may appear absurd to us, but Harbisson has been able to do so since 2004.\r\nIn the beginning, he would face a little difficulty but things changed once his brain began to adapt to the device, letting him see colors in his dreams. The device designed to aid him soon became a part of his body almost like an organ transforming him into a cyborg. The ability was not restricted to colors alone, He created a sound portrait describing the sound of one\\u2019s face. But there were several consequences too- he began to hear normal sounds, such as a telephone ringing, in the color green. Moreover visiting an art gallery or supermarket seemed like visiting a concert or a nightclub.\r\nSince 2010 Neil's non-profit organization The Cyborg Foundation has been fighting for cyborg rights and helping those who desire to be cyborgs.\r\nWhat are your thoughts?  Is CYBORG something meant only for comics? Should we advance ourselves into one?",

After knowing of the horrors of World War 2, more importantly, the Holocaust, the first question that comes to any sensible mind is why is this book even in print anymore. Even though the book is not a blueprint of the chambers of Auschwitz, to quote Major F. Elwyn Jones, junior counsel for the United Kingdom, \\u201cFrom Mein Kampf the way leads directly to the furnaces of Auschwitz and the gas chambers of Maidanek.\\u201d The book is essentially in two parts, the first part is \\u201cThe settlement of Accounts\\u201d or \\u201cRevenge\\u201d, was written in 1924 in the Bavarian fortress of Landsberg, where Hitler was imprisoned in 1923. It is in the first volume that we first see Hitler\\u2019s anti-Semitic ideas, and how the Germans are essentially the more pure race and the Jews are parasites. Not only that, he even talked about how it was more humane to \\u2018end the plight\\u2019 of the specially challenged, as that is the nature\\u2019s law, the survival of the fittest. And to him, no other race was better than the German Aryans. In Mein Kampf, Hitler used the main thesis of \"the Jewish peril\", which posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership. The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly anti-Semitic and militaristic, especially during his years in Vienna. Another thing we come to know in the first volume is Hitler\\u2019s relation with his father, even though according to most scholars, the filial affection between the men was rather fabricated by the author. An excerpt from the book reads \\u201cMy father forbade me to nourish the slightest hope of ever being allowed to study art. I went one step further and declared that if that was the case I would stop studying altogether. As a result of such \\u2018pronouncements,\\u2019 of course, I drew the short end; the old man began the relentless enforcement of his authority.\\u201d Lastly, the first volume talks about how the German masses should increase their living places, by encroaching onto the neighboring territories. This book is no work of literary masterpiece nor does it have any original ideas, also neither is it as appalling and snarly or creepy as one might think. What it does is provide the readers with is a monolog-ish repetitive narrative that might remain in the back of the mind of its readers. The second volume of the book, entitled \\u201cThe National socialist Movement\\u2019, after his release from the prison outlines the political program, including various methods to achieve a \\u201cnew order\\u201d.\r\n           \r\nThere was no doubt varied opinions\\u2019 regarding the reprinting of the book, especially in German, after the copyright rules expired in December of 2015. Two noteworthy things that should be mentioned here are that when the Nazi party came to power in 1933, it was not because of Hitler the writer but because of Hitler the orator because this book became a staple of the German households only after Hitler rose to power. The second and most important thing is that it now is better to talk about this book and its content in a classroom, rather than the curious pupils going on the internet to read about it, where the teachers cannot influence their opinions. So if you are looking to get a look at the mind of history\\u2019s most notorious even though morbidly most successful dictator, then get yourself a copy today and embrace yourself for quite a few grammar errors and mind numbing logic.",

A \"successful life\" is defined by how victoriously the map holder completes the journey that is set before him or her. As soon as a child can comprehend the meaning of words, a map of the long and difficult journey, described with hope and admiration, is set before them. The maps other than physical are passed on by mouth through family, friends, and acquaintances describing their experiences and opinions about the routes that they had taken on their own personal journey. A journey is made up of one overall map and various smaller maps, telling of the alternate routes that are available. On the map of my journey, I was told not to fall into the City of Trouble, to stay on Honor Street and continue on Career Road in order to end up at the town of Happiness and Security. My parents told me that I was expected to complete my journey of becoming both financially and emotionally stable.\r\nLife is the journey we all traverse riding on the train we call Time and running on the tracks we call Destiny. And in this journey we meet people, explore, learn and avail experience. It is a journey filled with lessons, hardships, heartaches, joys, celebrations and special moments that will ultimately lead us to our destination, our purpose in life. The road will not always be smooth; in fact, throughout our travels, we will encounter many challenges and some of these will test our courage, strengths, weaknesses, and faith. \r\nIt is a beautiful struggle. We must keep the journey going, not because of the guarantee but because of the possibility. It is a journey with so many options, a world to discover, dreams to chase, goals to reach and people to meet. So, continue on your imaginary map and reach your destination.",

      "body": "William Shakespeare in his poem \"The Seven Ages\" describes the phases of human life through soliloquies. \"All the world's a stage...\" appropriately reflects the metaphor of human life as a play with actors. One amongst those stages of life is the phase of being an innocent, slow, reluctant, school child.\r\nWhile we were mere cherubic lads our mothers used to narrate us bedtime stories. It was a phase when innocence over-shadowed almost every mistake. We believed in the irrationals of Santa Clause, Fairy Tales and even stories of Monster under the bed. They help in the instrumentation of a child's well being in the emotional and physical state.\r\nChildren are a reflection of emotions-smile, laugh, cry and with glittering eyes gazing with bewilderment. Moreover, they are a contemplation of pious air of heaven. They bring essence and notions of eternity. Gifted with physical beauty and innate humor they are a depiction of innocence. They grow up to bridge the gap between innocence and experience. They can trigger strong emotions; they stay happy for no reasons; they are curious and fight tirelessly for something. But, what's in a child that no adult has? Well, the answer is they live in the moment. They seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves them free to enjoy, which only a few adults can. The day we fret about our future is the day we grow up to be an adult. \r\nToday, a few of us are grown up while some still need to span this gap of being mature and experienced. Look at the night sky you'll see innocence. Listen to the chirping of innocent birds you'll experience calmness. Experience the earth breathing out of white and pink blossoms, you'll see what's it like raising a child. Life affords no greater responsibility, no greater privilege, than raising of the next generation. Let the child within ourselves lives before the phase of the second childishness and mere oblivion.",

Not only he encouraged his people for consuming this drug without proper medical consultation; now he is leaving no page unturned to secure the abundance of this drug stock for his nation.\r\n\r\nIndia, being the world\\u2019s largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, had put a temporary export ban on the drug. This was done in order to preserve the domestic stocks. But in a statement on Tuesday i.e 7th of April, Anurag Srivastava, a government spokesperson, said that India had lifted some restrictions after it has been confirmed by the respective officials that the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies has been secured. The drug has been categorized under 'licensed' but will be continuously monitored. And in medical front, these tablets are used to prevent and treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\nThe partial lifting of the export ban came only after Trump confirmed he had called Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India and basically threatened him of \\u201cretaliation\\u201d if the country did not release its stocks. This statement is a harsh contrast to the nature of relationship between the two as on his inaugural visit to India in February, Trump declared Modi as an \\u201cexceptional leader\\u201d and \\u201ctrue friend\\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe basis for the president\\u2019s proclamations of the drug as a \"game changer\" has been completely dismissed by pharmaceutical experts and major medical bodies. However it is very obvious that Trump has developed an obsession with hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure for coronavirus, and publicly also stated that the US had already stockpiled 29m doses of the drug. Now it remains to be seen what course of events follow given that more than 1500 patients in New York has already been dosed with the drug.",

And some nights you just don\\u2019t want to fight yourself anymore.\" \r\n-Laurell K. Hamilton\r\n\r\nEver since we were mere nestlings, we were taught to follow an appropriate path of becoming an ideal and reputed figure in society. Somewhere between getting those lessons from our parents and implementing them in our lives, we grew up. As we have turned into adults, we are expected to meet our demands, all by ourselves. As the society seeks, this is the idyllic age to bear witness to what we were taught. Our society asks us to be perfectly world-wise, curious and ingenious human beings. But, it doesn't teach us about the thorns that would come in our path while seeking the flowers. It has always expected the outcome off of us, irrespective of the pain and the struggles that life would engage us in.\r\n\r\nWhile a few of us emerged victorious from the sea of expectations, most of our boats are on the verge of sinking. The unending demands and wishes of the society meddle with our lives. Few get betrayed, while the rest get cheated on or are on the verge of perishing. All in all, it turns out that, we are unable to cope up with the state of affairs because we are under high societal pressure. Our society doesn't accept flaws. We entangle ourselves so much in searching success that we forget to love ourselves. We forget that failing gives rise to new hopes and aspirations. Above all, it gives rise to our new self.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the day, it all comes down to how much effort we put in. If we fail today, it implies that a new tomorrow awaits us. Maybe we couldn't seize the present day but who knows about tomorrow? Even the mighty Sun that shines majestic throughout the day has to set with the fall of the dawn. As the universe tips towards the commencement of a new beginning, so does our lives.\r\n\r\n\\u2022Picture Courtesy: \r\nAritra Majumder (16/ME/125)",

One amongst those prominent leaders was 67 years old Sushma Swaraj. On the night of 6th August 2019, we came across the news stating the untimely demise of India's best-loved politician. She suffered a cardiac arrest and was admitted to AIIMS Delhi. But, Alas! Destiny played its card.\r\nBorn on 14 February 1952, Swaraj came to be recognized as one of the eminent leaders when she stood in opposition to the then Prime Minister Ms. Indira Gandhi. She was elected as a Member of Parliament seven times and she even served as a member of the legislative assembly three times. In 1998, she was elected as the Chief Minister of Delhi. She was elected as the minister of external affairs for the tenure of 2014-19.\r\n\r\nSushma Swaraj was a great lady, an exceptional human being who never retreated from fulfilling her chores while serving as a ministry and helping the people in distress. She was an affectionate personality, a powerful orator, a true servant of our country and an inspiration to millions.\r\n\r\nWe extend our earnest condolences to this sorrowful and tragic demise. It's a national loss mourned by millions. May her soul rest in peace. You can rest now Sushma Swaraj Ji.",

      "body": "Name of the book: Why We Sleep\r\nAuthor: Matthew Walker\r\nRating: 4.5/5.0\r\nRecommended: Yes!!\r\n\r\n\"The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night\\u2019s sleep.\"\r\nMatthew Walker\r\n\r\nGiven the world that we survive in, we have all acquired more knowledge of sleeping pills than the actual effects of 'sleeping' itself. This book by acclaimed neuroscientist Matthew Walker delves into the startling information about the effects of suboptimal shut-eye levels. Yes, he does state a few facts, as in relating conditions due to lack of sleeping to Alzheimer's; which aren't quite medically proven as of till now. But, even if we leave out these small details, there's so much more to learn from this book.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we all do strive to be a better version of ourselves, and Walker just focuses on a minute but an extremely important factor to this self development. In this piece, he discusses on the role-play of sleep in all sorts of causes for morbidity and mortality. Grounded on today's culture, our author elaborates that how sleeping is wrongly tagged as something for wimps and the admiration we have for people who supposedly sleeps only four or five hours. As an example, he points at Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, both of whom consequentially succumbed to dementia. Also, he emphasizes the fact that crucially one cannot catch up on lost sleep and sleeping late at the weekend will not undo the damage done during the week and also how important it is to have a proper schedule for it.\r\n\r\nA little word of warning though that some pages can get a bit too dramatic. But on the fair parts, our writer is a certified neuroscientist, so trust him with his words. Hence, for all those late nighters and sleep deprived overworking studs out there, taking a peek into this book will help you to rectify your current situation.",

To understand this difference we need to go back to the very roots of grammar, specifically the parts of speech and also the different forms of English like the British, American, etc. In British English practise is a verb and practice is a noun. Whereas in American English,  practice is used as both the noun and verb. A general thumb rule for this can be those forms that end in ce or cy are nouns. The other forms that end in se or sy are verbs. Other examples include, advice\\u2019 is a noun, whereas \\u2018advice\\u2019 is a verb. In the same way, prophecy is a noun, whereas prophecy is a verb.\r\nExamples\r\n1. What advice do you have for the first day of college? (noun)\r\n2.

With 82 white marble domes adorning the top and 96 semi precious jewels in the internal columns, it really is an architectural wonder. The grand mosque was constructed between 1996 and 2007 under the guidance of Yousef Abdelky, a Syrian architect. The project was launched by late president of UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who wanted to unite the cultural diversity of Islamic world. His final resting place is in the courtyard of the complex.\r\n\r\nCurrently holding the title of the largest mosque, the Sheikh Zayed mosque has the capacity to take in 40,000 people in the main prayer hall with 1500 each in the sub-prayer hall, one of which is reserved for the women.\r\nAn artistical feat at its best, the mosque is quite appealing to look and has a calm and peaceful feeling, just by entering the mosque, you will feel as if you have been transported to the oriental world, where the sheikhs held the titular positions. The intricate marble work, the wall paintings, all of these contribute towards making the Sheikh Zayed mosque a one-of-a-kind place.\r\nSo, if you ever get a chance to visit Abu Dhabi, make sure you visit this mosque, although with the proper dress code; the men are not allowed to wear shorts whilst women are required to wear long sleeved shirts and long pants. Take in a brief moment of peace, an escapade from reality and dive into the cultural heritage as you visit the Sheikh Zayed mosque.",

He is haunted by his melancholic past. The suicide of his best friend Kizuki has him shattered and his only way forward is to move on and continue his academic front. This is when Naoko, the then girlfriend of his dead friend also comes to Tokyo for the same reason and a chance encounter one day brings them together.\\u00a0 In spite of their initial closeness, Naoko rejects any prospect of them being together. Then we also have the fun loving vivacious Midori, who also falls for Toru. But things don't turn out as easy on the surface. These three individuals are broken on the inside and are fighting their own demons. As life goes on, these characters find themselves amidst the adversities of the world, dwelling on the emotional aspects of life. The complicated relationships scarred by grief and death holds a very real dynamic of mortality in this piece.\r\n\r\nMurakami time and time tackles the rapacious aspects of some human relationships. He wrote this piece with detailed vision while portraying each of the characters to their realest form. The characters along with their personal journey is what makes this novel so heart wrenching and beautiful. Simplified writing and easy flow of the story just makes it more readable. Murakami creates an\\u00a0intricate web of plots which keeps the reader glued to the book. So, for anyone searching for some intensely emotional and real read, look no further than the \" Norwegian Wood.\"",

It is a language that tells us about a plight that must be understood.\\u201d \\u2013 Alice Miller\r\n\r\nThe human mind is a prolific home of contradictions, the mechanisms of which can churn out the best but can also be equally equipped to bring out the worst.\r\n\r\nThroughout decades, it is mankind that has repeatedly put its mettle to work in order to device some magic drug to cure an incurable disease. These torchbearers of our society have taken lifestyle light years ahead by providing people a chance to be free of pain or to live a longer life in health.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, it is also mankind that has stumbled upon the misuse of drugs, that was once a boon. Clinging to the stereotypes, we are well aware of the fact that the percentage of young adults on drugs is much more than the mid-aged strata of the society. Authoritarians and their eventual jurisdictions believe that cutting out their production or distribution might make society a drug free place to live in. Of course, this approach seems more feasible than addressing the real issue. Imposition of rules is always easier than diving to the root of the problem and fixing it. The questions to be asked are rather simple. \" Why do people do drugs?\" It's a naive belief that most people are on it just to have the fun of it. Mostly, on careful investigation of the conscience and the emotional background of these people, it is found out that drugs act as an escape route from reality, from society that must have left behind scars of unjust trauma, be it the pressure from parents to qualify as an exceptional academic, or unrequited love, or the trauma of physical harassment; the psychological aspects can be unending.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before quick conclusions of labeling such people as criminals, it is very important to hold a knowledge of the \"why\".\r\n\r\nThe answers may be difficult to address but it'll also open a more understanding and logical portal of approaching the problem. \r\nTherefore, on this day and every day to come, it goes out as a humble request to all people to wake up and face the darker corners of their mind and resolve the rotten sentiments that are safely tucked under the blanket of denial. Only then can we all find a way that diverges from the path of self-destruction due to subsequent drug abuse. \r\nOn the contrary, there is always hope for a better tomorrow, a productive life and a future that might look a lot more brighter without the euphoric bliss of drugs. Therefore, live and prosper and understand that problems are to be solved and met with solutions, not forgotten and ignored and stiffled by artificially synthesized chemical compounds. The human life is always more valuable and cherishable than that.",

      "body": "\\u2022Disclaimer: We do not concern ourselves with reviewing the film, rather, we want to throw light on how certain scenes, interpretations and dialogues in \"Kabir Singh\" went viral momentarily.\r\n\r\nKabir Singh. Just a mere name? No. It's a fictional character which, currently, is the talk of the town. A Bollywood film starring Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani as Kabir and Preethi, respectively, it is perhaps the most talked about film in 2019, being mired in various controversies as well. Moreover, it's the remake of the equally popular Tollywood film, titled Arjun Reddy, that released a year ago. While, Kabir Singh released a week ago and is earning hefty amounts of moolah at the box office, let's delve into the reality and know the exact reasons that popularized the film and made \\u201cKabir Singh\\u201d a household name.\r\n\r\n1) Many North Indians had indulged in watching Arjun Reddy, in Hindi-dub, in 2018 during its release. The original film, having few tinges of realism, succeeded in attracting North Indians too. They liked it and yearned for a Bollywood-remake, till June, 2019.\r\n\r\n2) Movie buffs these days tend to like aggressive and psychedelic characters more. Moreover, they liked Shahid Kapoor in films like Kaminey, Haider and Udta Punjab. Ergo, what's there to detest Kabir Singh?\r\n\r\n3) Films based on college-life, regardless the plausibility, have attracted college-goers, since time immemorial. That's a reason in itself.\r\n\r\n4) No sooner did the film get to see the light of the day than its boat started sinking into the unfathomable ocean of controversies. The mixed reviews that the film already received had a certain sector of the audience point out the vehemence exhibited on a na\\u00efve woman like \\u201cPreethi\\u201d and the maid servant of Kabir, by Kabir himself! These incidents instigated \\u201cmemers\\u201d. And the outcome? Tons and tons of memes on social media! Obviously, Kabir Singh gained utmost popularity.\r\n\r\n5) Lastly, the soulful and symphonious numbers in the album. (Sad songs have always been among the favourites!)\r\n\r\nOne week's passed since its release. Mostly, negative publicity made it viral. Mixed reviews. Mixed ratings. However, in B-town, every filmmaker wants to rule the box-office, which Sandeep Reddy Venga surely is doing, and would continue to do so for at least two weeks more. All hail commercial films!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the aptest reason for Kabir Singh to go viral to such an inexplicable extent? Let us know in the \\u201ccomments\\u201d section.",

Before sitting down to a meal, we wash our hands. But do we need to do the same after having the meal? Even though we had not touched the food with our hands and our hands are as clean as they could be! In certain traditions, you certainly do, because after having your food your hands are smeared in a kind of grime, that may or may not be visible to the eye. It is just there. Possibly invented by germaphobes of prehistoric times, it\\u2019s a kind of dirt that is just there, regardless of the fact, whether you can see it or not. Thus, the requirement of an extra handwashing, just to be on the safe side. In hindi we have the term 'juttha' and in bengali we call it 'Ettho.' In Judaism it is 'schmutz.' The only way to be rid of it is following your hand wash with a short prayer and lo! Your hands are spic and span!

As much as we want to lay back on our couches having a gala time watching our favourite series, it is equally important to add some value to these breaks. Amidst all the hustle and bustle that goes on in almost all engineering colleges throughout the semesters, these month long breaks are the time that a student gets for himself/herself, to nurture his/her own extra curriculars or explore some new arenas of their field of studies.\r\n\r\nThe fresh fourth years are mandated to intern at some organization during the summer break. Though there isn't any such uptight rule for the juniors, it is advisable that they do not indulge very much into a lazy and idle vacation. The thought of staying back at home and hanging out with loved ones might seem lucrative but a little bit of constructive utilization of the time would be beneficial. The world out there regards our CVs as our first impression. Hence it should be made sure that it is enriched, and this is the best time to work on it. We should avail the break to nurture our academical and non academical skills that would help us in the long run. The piled up assignments, lab work, internals during the semesters doesn't really allow us to work on ourselves for our own betterment.\r\n\r\nSo balance work and play, enjoy the break and at the same time get involved in constructive affairs.

      "body": "One of the most resplendent of the innumerable Hindu festivals, celebrated round the year, Ratha Yatra is the grand culmination of a series of celebrations spread across the months of summer and the monsoon. Akshayya Tritiya tithi marks the beginning of the construction of the Rathas(chariots) for the ceremonial journey and sojourn of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra at the Gundicha temple for a week. On the full-moon day of the month of Jyestha (May-June) in the Snana Yatra, the Bathing Festival, when the three deities move in colourful processions to a platform in the outer enclosure of the temple, the Snana Vedi, the bathing platform, where they bathe with one hundred and eight pitchers of perfumed water drawn from a temple well, annually.\r\n\r\nAfter the ritual bath, the deities assume the special elephant form, recalling the legend of the Lord's affection for a devotee, whom He proved that He was in fact another manifestation of Lord Ganesha. At the end of the Snana Yatra day, the holy triad, supposedly afflicted with fever, do not return to their pedestal in the sanctum. They stay away from the public view for a period of fifteen days, called Anasara, after which they appear in their Navayauvana Vesha, literally a renewed youth, on the new moon day of the Month of Ashadha.\r\n\r\nDuring this fortnight the icons get a fresh coat of painting which gets washed out on the day of the Bathing Festival. During this period the Sevakas, the temple servants, also symbolically convalesce with the deities and eat only fruits and other restricted diet. Cloth paintings, representing the deities called Anasara Pati, are displayed beyond the enclosers hiding the deities for the devotees to see and worship. Finally comes the Ratha Yatra on the second day of the bright fortnight of the month Of Ashadha when the three deities, come out of the temple in a spectacular procession called pahandi. The deities, colossal wooden statues, adorned with giant floral crowns, called Tahias, are literally pulled, pushed and dragged in rhythmic movement to the accompaniment of the beat of cymbals, drums and chanting of their names in chorus by devotees in frenzied ecstasy. After all the deities are seated in their respective chariots starts the Chhera Pamhara the ritual sweeping of the chariots with a golden broom by the Gajapati King of Puri,the foremost servant of God, the Adya sevaka of Lord Jagannath. The King comes from his palace on a richly decorated palanquin.\r\n\r\nThe most exciting part of the Rath yatra is the pulling of chariots by a plethora of people who lay their hands on the sturdy ropes and drag the massive structures along the Bada-Danda, the grand road. The Chariot of Balabhadra moves first, followed by those of Subhadra and Jagannath.\r\n\r\nThe return of the chariots takes place in the same order as in the rath yatra. Balabhadra's chariot moves first, followed by those of Subhadra and Jagannath. On the next day, the three deities, are attired in costumes of glittering gold and are worshipped by thousands of devotees.\r\n\r\nThe three Chariots of Balabhadra,Subhadra and Jagannath are constructed each year with Sal wood, customarily brought from the ex-princely State of Dasapalla, by a specialist team of carpenters having hereditary rights for this. Carpenters excelling at woodcarving still produce these chariots for the car festival, and also carve ornate images of deities upon them. While on the other hand applique work can be seen during processions of the deities in their various ritual outings.\r\n\r\nIn West Bengal, Rath Yatra is celebrated with almost matchable grandeur of that in Puri. Temples of Lord Krishna are thronged by His devotees where Kirtans are sung with utmost devotion. Children decorate and pull small chariots, having idols of the three deities, on the footpaths, in observance of this day. In all, there's happiness everywhere and in every heart!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, The HIT Times wishes all the readers a Shubh Rath Yatra; Jai Jagannath!",

      "body": "Everyone requires a medium of entertainment in life- be it reading preferent books or an article, or watching fave movies with family and loved ones- it could be anything. Many find gaming apps on cellphones entertaining and end up being glued to them for hours- that's still fine. However, what isn't fine is the usage of certain apps, which, when used in the name of procrastination, could lead to untoward predicaments. One of the most popular of these is TikTok, the video-making app, which some people find \\u201centertaining\\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt all started 3 years ago and spread almost like an epidemic- towards the end of 2017. Almost everyone on earth was cognized of its presence in the Play Store. The unnecessary hype made more people download it and, what was next? It became intensely viral in India, in a jiff!\r\n\r\nIt was still fine until the onset of 2018, when Indians were helplessly hooked onto TikTok, making videos- some being too cringeworthy to watch. Thus, they ended up procrastinating and harming themselves in ways unimaginable.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, the TikTok trend has reached the hospital wards too!\r\n\r\nThe gaucherie crossed all its limit recently, when a group of \\u201cnurses\\u201d, working in a neonatal care unit, at a hospital in Odisha, were found making videos on TikTok, while the new-born babies were left unattended!\r\nIn one of the viral videos, the nurses were seen dancing to the tunes of Bollywood songs. In another, a nurse even posed with a new born baby in her arms. Most of the videos were recorded with bed and stretchers in the background- slow claps for the act of shame and jejunity!\r\n\r\nHowever, as the video of them swooning to Bollywood numbers went viral, instead of condemning it, they ignored it as they've been doing since ages. Actions were supposed to be taken, however, as nothing happened to the babies, no action was taken to throw them out of the hospital for an act of negligence like that. What if something dreadful had happened to the new-borns? Then who'd have been answerable for the happenings?\r\n\r\nAlthough, a few months ago, Supreme Court had banned the usage of the app, it lifted the ban eventually. Since then, people have started using it with all their passion and dedication! May God bless them and make them realize what dire conditions they've put themselves into...",

      "body": "Sapiens : A Brief History of Humankind review \r\n\r\n\r\n'Sapiens : A Brief History Of Humankind' by Yuval Noah Harari is a non-fiction book first published in Hebrew in 2011, later published in English in 2014. It aims to understand \"the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be 'human.'\" - as per the book itself. For barely over four and half a hundred pages, it's a lofty goal to set. \r\n\r\nThe book begins even before the beginning of humankind, and takes the reader on a journey through the 4 major landmarks in human evolution - the cognitive revolution, the agricultural revolution, the unification of mankind, and the modern society. Rather long anthropogenetic processes merged with cognitive improvements, allowing the capacity to jump from the material to the abstract, leading to creation of complex imaginary structures that exist only in our collective imagination. These structures then evolved, creating unprecedented and powerful abstractions like gods, money and LLCs. This whole process is put under the historian's microscope for careful examination. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the author himself is a professor at the Department of History, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nDespite a serious subject, the book is neither dense nor boring. The writing and pacing is reminiscent more of a mystery novel than a research paper. The points made are accessible for even a novice and the research behind  them do not manifest tediously in the text at any point. The writing style is that of a storyteller, not sterile at all. Simply put, the book is easy to read and interesting. As a result, it has been received very well by the mass and has made its way to many domestic conversations, a place most non-fiction books fail to reach. Many have called it a publishing phenomenon and a turning-point for the genre. \r\n\r\nBeing a book written for the mass market and being, consequently, reasonably sized means that while the array of subjects covered by the book is impressive, the depth of information presented is  definitely not. And while the book succeeded at getting accolades and awards aplenty, critics and experts on the subject have made it abundantly clear that the book is meant to be served as infotainment, not an academic compendium. Some have even said that it is not credible source of information and should not be touted as such.\r\n\r\nSo, is it worth a read? Well, if you are not an expert on anthropogenesis and sociology,  I believe this book will educate you a lot. And even if you're are an expert, you will still be able to get some value from a new perspective. After all, it is not only a popular science book, but also rather engaging, well written story.",

      "body": "Before we dive head-first into discussing the concerning issues of the world population, let us know a little about how the World Population Day came into existence. On July 11th 1989, the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme established World Population Day, to raise awareness on global population issues. It was to highlight the challenges and opportunities of population growth and its impact on our planet's sustainability, heavy urbanization, availability of health care and youth empowerment. Envisaged as an annual event, it was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987-approximately the date on which the world\\u2019s population reached five billion people.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the population of the world is about 7.7 billion people and growing at a rate of around 1.07% per year. Therefore, in order to support 11 billion people by 2100, we must change the way we use the world\\u2019s resources. The world economy must grow but if we don\\u2019t radically change the way we consume the planet, we will be heading for the end of our consumer society and standard of living as we know it.\r\n\r\nAt current trends, the planet cannot sustain twice as many people and a 26 times larger economy that will be needed to support additional people. According to the United Nations, there is need for a new industrial revolution where economic wealth goes hand-in-hand with environmental and social sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe challenge awaits us, and hopefully we are up for it. Otherwise future generations will face war, famine, massive migration, and genocide of ethnic and religious groups.",

Where does positive vibe even enter our frame of mind? The truth is yes, our society is shrewd. However, let us not forget the good things that God has placed before us. Let us remember the Lord still reigns in ultimate authority.\r\n\r\nA primary way God nourishes our souls with his loving presence is through the beauty of nature. The moon and stars remind us that God\\u2019s light and love shine on us even in the dark. Nature reveals to us God\\u2019s beauty, glory, power, wisdom and presence. This is why we\\u2019re drawn to spend time in the beauty of nature and to enjoy animals.

God\\u2019s creation contains an astonishing abundance in and variety of beauty that constantly surprises and delights us.

Each day we\\u2019re barraged not just by beautiful sights of cedars, oaks, and firs, but by sundry smells of wildflowers and ripening fruit, or the sweet sounds of songbirds and rustling wind. The deeper we explore our world, the more beauty we find. Because of all the sins, we tend to focus so much on the negative aspects of the world that we fail to see the beauty that is in front of us. Sometimes it is blissful to sit back and think about how wonderful our world is. Let us embrace the splendour of God even it\\u2019s a little cracked.",

Greater in defeat than the conqueror. \"\r\n- Zora Neale Hurston\r\n\r\nThe 14th of July marked the end of the 13th edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup. But, for Indian fanatics, their world cup was over when the Indian team got knocked out in one of the most edge-of-the-seat thriller Semi-finals. Though they were unable to bring the trophy to our country, they emerged successful in winning hearts with their spectacular performances in almost every match. The team finished atop the table. The team showed a brilliant game throughout the tournament and the fans never stepped back to shower them with love and support.\r\n\r\nDuring the semi-finals, we were all caught in a wonderful, agonizing sense of expectations, but, alas! All our expectations met an unexpected hit when the team lost its last hope. The defeat literally made the fans cry. Some used the Indian flags, which they had wrapped around themselves to wipe their tears. Disappointed fans left the stadium with a heavy heart, unable to believe that their team lost. While most fans accepted this defeat, others were seen creating a ruckus and committing hooliganism. Perpetrating such acts for the sake of grabbing public attention won't see any outcome. Does harming ourselves really help us get yet another try at the World cup? Well, no, not even at the cost of someone's life. A true fan doesn't indulge in such infantile acts rather he waits to come back and support his team with full glee and joy the next time around.\r\n\r\nThe saga of the rendition of the world cup will continue. Let the critics say what they have to. Let the board decide where they went wrong. Until then, we fans will do what we've done since always- that is to love and support our team unconditionally no matter the outcome.",

The advent of lucrative internet packages in the market followed by online streaming portals like Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Netflix, Hoichoi etc has essentially paralyzed the older ways. \r\nApart from that, the radical thinking population of the country has exhibited promising consumption of entertainment with intelligent and practical content. Shows like Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Sacred Games have essentially taken the market by storm.

      "body": "Potterheads! Today is one of our glory days...because, on this very day, 30 years ago, was born a child, who was destined to bring the character of 'Harry Potter' to life! Its none other than Daniel Radcliffe's 30th Birthday!\r\n\r\nDaniel Radcliffe overshined the stars when he first appeared as Potter, in 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' in 2001, being a 12 year-old. Fans watched him grow up as Harry through eight films released over the course of a decade until the final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, released in 2011 when Radcliffe was 22 years old. But put aside his signature character as Harry, how well do you know the English actor? From 'The Simpsons' to his connection to Charles Dickens, here are five interesting facts about him, as he turns 30 today.\r\n\r\n1. Daniel Radcliffe wanted to act since he was 5 years old and he made his screen debut at the age of 10 in BBC One's TV adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel 'David Copperfield', portraying the titular character as a young boy.\r\n\r\n2. 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' (2001) was not Daniel Radcliffe's first film. He made his Hollywood debut in 'The Tailor of Panama', a 2001 film based on John le Carr\\u00e9's 1996 spy novel.\r\n\r\n3. Daniel Radcliffe is a huge fan of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar and he cherishes an autograph he got from the batting legend after the Lord's test in July 2007. Owing to his love for cricket, Daniel aspired to play the game for England.\r\n\r\n4. He suffers from dyspraxia or developmental coordination disorder. It is a condition that affects your brain's ability to communicate with your body, making common motor skills difficult. Daniel's condition is mild, but he has expressed trouble with small tasks like tying shoelaces and writing.\r\n\r\n5. Besides his film debut, his first non-Harry Potter film is 'December Boys' 2007 and first post-Harry Potter film is 'The Woman in Black' in 2012, 'Kill Your Darlings' 2013, 'Horns,' a must-watch, in 2014, 'Victor Frankenstein' in 2015, and 'Swiss Army Man', Now You See Me 2, and Imperium in 2016. He has tried to shed his 'Harry Potter' image along the way by featuring on Broadway and Indie films. Other than movies, he has voiced characters on 'The Simpsons'. He guest starred as Edmund in 'Treehouse of Horror XXI' (2010) and as 'Diggs' in an episode by the same name in 2014.",

Developed by a Russian company named Wireless Lab, \\u201cFaceApp\\u201d uses Artificial Intelligence to generate highly realistic transformations of faces in photographs. The app can not only transform a face to make it look older but can also change gender.\r\n\r\nUnless you ain\\u2019t a social media fanatic or have been living underwater, you\\u2019ve definitely come across various people posting a pair of photos, one of the present and another of the future. Eventually, the \\u201chashtags\\u201d such as #FaceAppChallenge and #FaceAppIsTheFuture viralled and almost everyone in every corner of the world began using it for fun! Moreover, the ageing filter became the most popular app, with Drake, Hilary Duff, Gordon Ramsay and LeBron James, among a number of celebrities, showcasing their future faces on social media.\r\n\r\nWhile the app has taken the world by storm, last week, the app was in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, with keen-eyed observers pointing out that the app's terms of use give its Russian parent company a very broad, global and lifelong licence to use the images. In short, once you sign up and use the app, the company can do pretty much whatever it likes with your photos. It could plaster a wrinkled version of your face across a billboard, website or the side of a skyscraper, and you would have no legal recourse.\r\n\r\nOf course, as experts have correctly pointed out, this is extremely unlikely to happen. Russia's only interest in your photo data would be for facial recognition software development. Wireless Lab has also publicly stated that most photos are deleted within 48 hours of upload and no information is sent to Russia, but rather is stored temporarily on the company's American servers.\r\n\r\nSo, is \\u201cFaceApp\\u201d really worth using?\r\n\r\n\\u201cFaceApp\\u201d is undeniably fun, and is currently the most popular free app in Australia, ahead of Instagram and YouTube. Downloads of the app to US iPhones have increased by 561 percent in the past month. Any playful app that spreads joy can be a good thing. It is crucial, however, that users know what they are signing up for, otherwise many of their legal rights will vanish and their legal exposure will be extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAs if wrinkled skin and grey hair weren't bad enough!",

      "body": "The past couple of days has been synonymous to a rollercoaster ride for the Indian Government. Beginning from the launch of Chandrayan 2 to the abrogation of Article 370, the Modi government truly has emerged victorious in gaining public appraisal and an administrative milestone. The tenure also witnessed the abolition of the Three Talakh system putting an end to the fallacious practice of irresponsible divorce. While the public sector of India has had various views on the decisions being taken, the majority has emerged out to be on the positive side of the coast.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest reforms that's going to make it's way to the pages of history is the annulment of Article 370. The Article 370 equipped the state to have a different Constitution, followed by the acquisition of a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state. Previously under the article of 35A, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir were subjected to a set of laws that greatly varied from those that were implemented for the rest of the Indian citizens. Taking into consideration these separate laws, they included the domain of citizenship, ownership of property and fundamental rights among a plethora of others. \r\nOn the 6th of August, the Indian Constitution underwent a noteworthy change under the Presidential rule of Ram Nath Kovind, which revoked the 1954 order and extended all the provisions of the Indian constituent to be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir, while also declaring them Union Territories.\r\n\r\nFor a prolonged period of time the rebellions in the area had been a major concern for the government, and has finally found addressal after a lengthy period of time. Since we are no holders of Political Science degrees, it becomes difficult for a layman to understand the overall implications of the order. Since there always exists two sides of a coin, this too may include both negative and positive aspects. But, owing to the merit and administrative experience of the experts behind this decision, we as Indian citizens hope for the best and for a better tomorrow for the newly formed Union Territories with a wide array of prospects ready to be explored.",

The day is celebrated to mark the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son as obedience to god. But, before he could sacrifice his son, God provided a lamb to sacrifice instead. In remembrance of this intercession, an animal is sacrificed ritually and divided into three parts. The parts are then distributed amongst the poor and needy, kept for home and are given to relatives. Moreover, this day also marks the end of the annual Hajj to Mecca.\r\n\r\nThis day is considered to be the holiest festival for the followers of Islam. A sense of felicity encapsulates the ambiance as the day breaks. People tend to plunge themselves into the devotion and celebration of the festival. The day is witnessed by feasting on seasonal delicacies and relishing sumptuous meals. Finally, a goat is sacrificed in commemoration of the past events. The roots of sacrificing a goat or a sheep lie in the fact that they played a pivotal role in the life of humans in the olden days contributing to rearing and other purposes. The festival isn't just meant for sacrifices, rather it is meant to make humans learn to subdue their desires and selfishness, thus enabling humans to hinder their ability to fulfill their responsibility as a Muslim.\r\n\r\nWe, The HIT Times, extend our earnest wishes on the juncture of this Eid-ul-Adha. May the deity fulfills everyone's wishes and help every individual grow to be a better individual and prosper in his dreams.\r\n\r\nEid Mubarak!",

      "body": "Stepping into the life of a hosteler, for the first time, can be tough. It takes more than a while to adjust to this novu lifestyle and it can take a toll on you. But like everything else in life, the experience of living in a hostel is one of its kinds, and having some tips for hostel life can always come in handy. You can thank us later...\r\n\r\n1. Smuggle in Home-made Food As Often As You Can!\r\n\r\nWhenever you visit home, make sure you get yourself some home-cooked meals because it should not come as a surprise that food in the hostel mess sucks big time! This is one of the cardinal tips for hostel life, and one that will earn you many friends as well!\r\n\r\n2. Share And Get Your Share Back (With Interest).\r\n\r\nPeople in the hostel will take your stuff, whether you like it or not. There isn't going to be a prosecution. No trials, no uneasiness, and poof!...Your shampoo vanishes from the face of existence. Accepting this is one hard, painful and unfair rule is what takes time. But remember this slogan, the more you share, the more you can borrow! If there is anything you need to know about hostel life, it is that sharing is GETTING BACK YOUR SHARE, DOUBLY!\r\n\r\n3. Learn To Say \\u201cNo!\\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is technically the most important lesson, so, learn it well. It will be easier to say yes to everything and everyone, initially, to get along with people, but soon it will start affecting the rest of your life. While you might be getting worked up about how to make hostel life interesting, do understand that it should not come at the cost of your piece of mind. Understand that it is okay to agree with everything or stay up late just because everyone else is. Refusing to lend your expensive earphones to the most irresponsible person does not make you arrogant or stuck-up. If anything, it makes you more confident in life.\r\n\r\n4. Adopt Subtle Techniques To Avoid People...\r\n\r\nIt is quite normal to get a little annoyed with people around you when you live with them 24x7. Instead of expressing that emotion through your words and expressions, try to avoid them for a while using subtle techniques like plugging in your earphones when you see them approaching, pretending to be sleeping or reading something. Chances are in a few days you will be over that feeling and things can go back to normal without them ever finding out!\r\n\r\n5. (psst) Keep Some Money Stowed Away...\r\n\r\nYou never know where you end up spending money when living on your own, especially in a hostel, when you can\\u2019t keep a track of every small coin you spend on yourself or others. And before you know it, you are left with an empty wallet. Try to take out some money in the beginning of the month and hide it away in your almirah, for a rainy day. This is one of those tips for hostel life that you will always thank us for, and you'd better...\r\n\r\n6. Hang Out With Your Roommates At Least Once A Week!\r\n\r\nIt is SO important to get on well with your rookies - after all, you are going to spend a lot of time doing absolutely nothing with them. So make sure you and your roommates make plans or do something together at least once a week. It could be as simple as watching a movie or as complicated as prepping for doomsday, just make sure you do it! Trust us, this is pivotal for you to adjust in hostel!\r\n\r\n7. Be Friendly With The Hostel Guards/ Warden/ Cook.\r\n\r\nThey are the ones who will give you the most perks during your hostel life - be it an extra piece of chicken or a late entry (for girls, especially) or permission to stay away for the weekend, they can make everything easier for you. Be sweet and strike up small talk whenever you can, it will take you a long way! Let us just say that of all our tips for hostel life, this one is essential for your survival!\r\n\r\n8. Test The Bathroom Before You Step In!!!!!\r\n\r\nVery. Very. Important.\r\n\r\nHonestly, you don\\u2019t want to be stuck in a cubicle with no water and it always happens at the worst time too! This is practically survival 101 when it comes to how live in college hostel! Check the showers, the drainage and...THE bathroom lights...\r\n\r\n9. Get Up-to-date With All the latest streaming TV series.\r\n\r\nYou\\u2019ll need this ultimate piece of knowledge to strike up a good conversation with basically anybody in your hostel. This will also give you long hours of life-changing conversations and future binge-buddies! Of all our tips for hostel life, this one is definitely the most fun!\r\n\r\n10. Learn Basic Life Chores...\r\n\r\nIt\\u2019s high time to learn basic adulting, guys! Washing your clothes and dishes, cleaning up your room once in a while - you will need to learn all of this on your own. But don\\u2019t freak out, once you see everyone around you fumbling with the same things, you\\u2019ll know it will all be fine!\r\n\r\n11. Practice Sleeping In Noise, literally...!\r\n\r\nNope, no one will lower the volume for you around here, sadly, and if you are one of those people who need absolute silence to fall asleep then you are in for a lot of sleepless nights. The best way to adjust is to practice sleeping with music playing or the TV on before you move into your hostel to acclimatize your sleep cycle to what lies ahead!\r\n\r\n12. Train Your Nose!\r\n\r\nMore than often , you will envy the noseless Lord Voldemort and find yourself living with people who don\\u2019t care much about hygiene or are just plain lazy! While you can\\u2019t badger your hostel mates all the time to clean up after them, you sure can train your nose to avoid the 'smells'! Trust us, this is your initiation into how to live in college hostel! And the billion dollar advice, keep a room freshner in handy.\r\n\r\n13. Make The Most Of Your Electric Kettle.\r\n\r\nThe electric kettle is going to be your faithful little Dobby, not only by boiling milk and water, but also can make you life-saving maggie, boiled eggs, and even scrambled eggs!\r\n\r\n14. Befriend Locals.\r\n\r\nNow this is one of those essential tips for hostel life that will help you get through your BTech course! Befriend the local pupils and you can unlock all the insider information on cool hangout spots, cafes, and the best part, you get to indulge in home-cooked food every once in a while!\r\n\r\n15. Lastly, be a good student and do nothing but study.\r\n\r\nKidding! XD\r\n\r\nAnyway,\r\nDespite all its shortcomings, hostel life is really fun and thrilling... make sure you enjoy all of it and make the most out of it! The HIT Times wishes you to experience the best moments of your lifetime in this college!",

On a positive note, we are elated to witness the sky-high enthusiasm among all the freshers. Amongst you would be many who were aspiring for IIT's and NIT's but have to settle for HIT instead, or there would be some who took a year or two off and still ended up here. As of now, what matters is that you stand at the verge of a new journey, a voyage filled with gags and gasps, anticipation, with ups and downs, and with sweet n sour life experiences. \r\nA college is a place that will help you grow as an individual with self-esteem. It'll help you prosper but only when you're ready to invest yourself in it. College is all about thriving and having an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a knowledge that isn't just restricted to course books but rather the one implemented practically. But, engineering isn't served on a silver platter. It comes at the cost of unlikely experiences. There would be days when you would feel elated, others will make you feel dejected which might lead to questioning your very existence. There would be days when you would encounter a flock of perturbing species, have a fight with your roommates, will meet college deadlines, will run short on attendance and lastly, will somehow manage to surpass the examinations. Lately, you'll come to know that all the memes on engineering students which you came across while scrolling down your newsfeed weren't just pun intended but rather the fluctuating situation of a B-Tech undergrad. But, as the years will succeed you'll get to know that engineering life is much beyond to what it is shown through social media. \r\nA four-year course will go in the bimgurl of an eye and the one having the constant determination to make something good out of everything will emerge victoriously. You'll succeed once you let the faith in you rise from the veils and fear of failures. Let your inner self strive for perfection. Be brave, be curious and ingenious. May at the end of your four-year you bask in the glory and leave footprints behind inscribed on the premises of Haldia Institute Of Technology. \r\nLast but not least, college is like a multilayered gift. The more you unveil it, the closer you reach to bear its fruit. Like peacock's feathers, it's time for you to outshine others. \r\n\r\nWith due regards and best wishes,\r\nThe HIT Times",

      "body": "Originally, Rakshabandhan was an idea instilled with the motive of inculcating solidarity amongst Indian men and women, that sprouted during the desperate times of the Freedom Movement against the British rule. The brain behind the festival was Rabindranath Tagore, who meticulously foresighted the establishment of an unbreakable bond through this practice and eventually turned it into reality.\r\n\r\nToday the festival is of significance mostly in the Hindu culture that consists of a sister tying a talisman or a rakhi around the wrists of her brother in prayer of his good health and fortune. But with modern days approaching, the day just doesn't celebrate the relation between a sister and a brother, but it celebrates the kinship between siblings in general as well.\r\n\r\nWith birth, we acquire the love, the affection and the guidance of our parents. We receive a selfless shelter under their protective shade as we thrive to become the human beings that we are. But often in this journey, quite a large number of people are blessed with siblings, and they are the ones that teach us the most essential lessons of life- the ability to compromise, adjust, development of patience, the value of sharing and most importantly how to break the rules without getting caught. They are the first best friends that we make, the first partner in crime that we acquire, the first person to know about our first crush, the first shoulder to lean on during rough days and the first pillar of support we run to. It's the bittersweet relationship where we love to hate each other yet cannot live without the constant Tom and Jerry chase. So on this day of Rakshabandhan, here's a big thank you to all the brothers and sisters for lying about bunked tuitions, for saving us from those terrible beatings, for covering for all the mischief, for being a comrade in all the criminal activities, for lending a hand of support even when we were too afraid to ask and above all for teaching us how to love during times when all we wanted to do was give you a chokeslam. The relation between siblings is too beautifully chaotic yet real, consuming yet comforting, raging yet soothing, ruthless yet compassionate, selfish yet selfless. So, celebrating this wonderfully arranged array of contradictions, The HIT Times wishes everyone a very Happy Rakshabandhan and we hope that the day is enriched by the envigorating process of memory making with lots of laughter and fun and joy.",

Promenading along the beach, make an effort to look beyond the horizon. Witness the sea, the sea that's calm one moment, choppy the next, briny and aggressive, relentless yet silent. Standing onshore, when the territorial waters wash off one's feet, don't be just elated rather observe and learn. The hurling waves, coming in from the far distance, gleaming and sparkling, resembling the constant motion of the sea instructs us to keep moving and always thriving for better aspects in our lives. Some days these tides are low with minuscule elevations while a few days they tend to grow high and majestic. Our lives are somewhat comparable, resembling this analog of constant ups and downs. It is necessary for us to have those days in our lives as they impart us with lessons that remain attached to us throughout our life-span. Every time you lose hope, life will present you with its form of serenity and vibrancy. The breeze will fetch vigor, while the saltiness will prepare you for the unexpected bitter parts in life and the beauty will teach you to adore. If God can create foreshore sand to stand against the mighty waves, then think of yourself as the sand and stand against the rage of the sea. Like the sea leaves its saltiness behind and comes back to us with the sweeter part, the alimental and pious form, learn to snub the hurdles that lie in your path. The day you'll learn will be the day you'll succeed!",

      "body": "Krishna Janmashtami or Janmashtami or Gokulashtami is a Hindu festival celebrated widely across the country every year to mark the birth of Lord Krishna. Krishna, who is also one of the eights avatar of Lord Vishnu was born on the eighth day of Krishna Paksha as a son to Devaki and Vasudeva. He was brought up in nandavrajam to live with his foster mother Yashoda and foster father Nanda. Being brought up in a Yadav family he was very fond of eating \"Makhana\" which he used to steal from his mother's kitchen. This gave him the name of \"Natkhat Nand Lal\". Lord Krishna is considered to be a major deity in Hinduism. He is also said to be the omniscient incarnation of Vishnu who was born with a purpose to free the world from evil. As a result, he was the one to kill his evil maternal uncle Kansa. Furthermore, he played a crucial role in the great war at Kurukshetra predominately known as Mahabharat. Being a charioteer to Arjuna he imparted him with the lessons of the holy Bhagavad Gita. He preached about Karma and the theory of Bhakti.\r\n\r\nThis year Janmashtami falls on 23rd August 2019. The day is marked by various celebrations across the country in order to please Lord Krishna. One of the most prominent celebration is the \" Dahi Handi\". Mathura and Vrindavan being the two most important places where Lord Krishna is said to have lived his childhood, celebrates the festival of Janmashtami with great fervor and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWe, The HIT Times, wishes everyone an auspicious Janmashtami. May Lord Krishna fulfill everyone with the knowledge to contemplate between good and evil. May he shower everyone with abundance love, prosperity, felicity and peace.",

      "body": "The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest on Earth. It creates 20 percent of the oxygen in Earth\\u2019s atmosphere.\r\nThe rainforest is home to 40 percent of the worlds tropical forest and holds 20 percent of the worlds freshwater supply. It is also home to 10 percent of the world\\u2019s species and 40,000 plant species and around 3000 varieties of edible fruits.\r\nFurther, the Amazon rainforest is also the natural habitat of 430 species of mammals and millions of insect species.\r\nSadly, the lungs of our Earth, is at the risk of getting burned out completely. The rainforest, has been burning for over 16 days, resulting in a major loss of trees and biodiversity. It will get completely burned out if its not extinguished soon.\r\nGlobal outrage tore through social media, with #PrayforAmazonia as the world's top trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday.\r\n- Cause:\r\nAccording to environmentalists, 99 percent of the forest fires are a result of human actions, either on purpose or by accident. Farmers and ranchers use fire generally to clear the land for further utilisation. This year's fires also fit perfectly into the established seasonal agricultural pattern. This time is the most suitable to burn because the vegetation is dry. Farmers generally wait for the dry season to start burning and clearing areas so that their cattle can graze, However, the peak of the dry season is yet to come in September.\r\nEnvironmentalists blame Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for the forest fires. When Bolsonaro was running for president, he had promised to restore Brazil's economy by exploring the economic potential of the Amazon rainforest. As per environmentalists, Bolsonaro has encouraged the farmers and ranchers to exploit and burn the rainforest like never before.\r\nThe UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also expressed deep concern over the blazing fire in the Amazon rainforest.\r\n- Impact:\r\nThe fire in Brazil\\u2019s Amazon rainforest has been burning at the highest rate. \"There have been around 72,843 fires in Brazil in 2019 itself, with more than half in the Amazon rainforest. This shows an 80 percent increase in fires during the same period in 2018.\"\r\nAccording to scientists, \"the Amazon rainforest fire could deliver a huge blow to the global fight against climate change. The fire will not only result in a major loss of trees and partiulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.\"\r\nAmazon rainforest is considered to be as the planet\\u2019s lungs as it contributes about 20 percent of the earth\\u2019s oxygen, is vital to slow down global warming. The rainforest is currently home to uncountable species of fauna and flora. While the immediate impact of the fire would be changes in the heating of the regional atmosphere, in the long term it is expected to lead to a potential decline in natural carbon.\r\n- Action taken:\r\nBolivia has contracted its Boeing 747 \\u2018Supertanker,' the largest air tanker, to help put out the Amazon rainforest fire. The supertanker is expected to be put in operations from August 23. The announcement was made by Bolivia\\u2019s President Evo Morales on August 21, 2019. The Boeing 747 \\u2018Supertanker\\u2019 has the capacity to carry more water than any other aircraft in the world.\r\nIt seemed, the Earth was also willing to help when the sky broke into rainfall, answering a thousand prayers from all around the Globe.",

People across the country worship the deity by installing clay idols either at their home or at elaborate pandals. The devotees tend to immerse themselves in chanting hymns, prayers, and fasting, as in order to bring good fortune and health. Ganesha is said to be the god of a new beginning, the remover of obstacles, and the god of wisdom and intelligence.\r\n\r\nWhile the celebration and festivities encircle the entire country, the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu to name a few, celebrates the festival with a nonpareil magnificence.

Although it marks the first Islamic month, the tenth day of Muharram is also known for being a period of mourning where the Shia Muslim community commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the son of Hazrat Ali and the grandson of Prophet Muhammad.\r\n\r\nConsidered one of the most significant festivals celebrated by the Muslim community, many Shias observe this day by participating in processions and self-flagellation. Mourners use sharp objects such as knives or chains, which have blades attached to them, and other weapons in acts of self flagellation while chanting 'Ya Hussain' loudly. Sunni Muslims, on the contrary, observe this day with a fast that lasts from sunrise to sunset. They also hold gatherings to remember the sacrifices of Imam Hussain and attend special prayers in mosques.\r\n\r\nOn a concluding note, we, from The HIT Times, wish for the well-being of you and your family.

The \\u2018world ozone day\\u2019 came into existence after the Montreal Protocol was signed on the same day it is celebrated, that is, 16th of September, in the year 1987. The protocol is basically an international treaty passed by the United Nations general assembly to protect the ozone layer from substances which causes its depletion. These include man-made chemicals constituting of chlorine and bromine.The chief ozone-depleting substances include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and methyl chloroform. Halons, sometimes known as brominated fluorocarbons, also contribute mightily to ozone depletion. ODS substances have a lifetime of about 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe theme of World Ozone Day 2019 is '32 years and Healing'. This year's theme celebrates three decades of remarkable international cooperation to protect the Ozone Layer and the climate under the Montreal Protocol. The main aim of this day was to propose and execute measures to protect the ozone layer and also educate people about its importance. Over the past decade, the ozone layer has recovered at a rate of 1-3%. Even at the protected rates, Northern hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone will heal completely by the 2030. The Southern Hemisphere will follow in 2050 closely accompanied by the Polar Regions in 2060. If not, then there will surely be a surge in skin cancer, respiratory problems, eyesight problems and a lot more. However, as of now, the measures taken to protect it has been mildly successful especially in the developed nations, with the developing nations not far behind. For example, India, which became a signatory member of the protocol in 19th June 1992, abides by all the measures of the protocol such as to ban the use of chloro fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons and other toxic components in air conditioning systems, refrigerators, etc.Therefore, it is our duty as sincere inhabitants of the planet to help contribute to the recovery of the ozone layer and enable our future generations to lead a healthier and more prosperous life.",

Was it a splendid and exquisite scenery, or was it a lake filled with trouts? It was rather a garden ornamented with fancy ferns, and flowers rich in the color of coral and shades of lavender. One may ponder as to why he introspected so much? Exploring oneself through the intricacies of life is like a four-leaf clover, which has always been hard to trace. A garden isn't just a picturesque image to behold, but the pictorial color it offers, detecting even the infinitesimal blossom helps us grow and develop from within. This inner-development and knowing ourselves of who we truly are is Self-introspection. Self-introspection helps us know our purpose, values, goals, and beliefs. But, it is something that comes at a cost which not all can fulfill. A day would come when it won't be a case of \"he/she\" but rather a case of \"you\". We are all tranquil and non-agitated. We've all got the brushes of our lives in our hand, and what to paint on the canvas depends on us.

And his last words were \"I go to seek a Great Perhaps.\" That's why I'm going. So I don't have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps.\"\r\n__Miles ( From 'Looking for Alaska')\r\n \r\nVery fresh and real ' Looking for Alaska' is the debut novel of John Green. This novel is one of those kind, which piles on one's self reflection and holds the reader till the end. Even though on surface, the book might come off as a little ' immature coming-of-age, boy-meets-girl' piece, in unfolded reading it's much more than that.\r\n\r\nThe best part about this book is that the plot cooked here doesn't follow any particular receipe. The rawness and brutality in Green's writing, draws a very honest light on adolescence and complexities of the youth life. The book has two segmented parts, both carefully parted and imgurled.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, a 16 year old curious Miles 'Pudge' Halter leaves Florida to attend a new school at Alabama. There in his befriended group, he meets the beautiful, funny but emotionally wounded Alaska and their story jets off from there.\r\nThe first half deals with their adjustment to life and the developing attachments. While the later segment is about Alaska's sudden death, how it affects them all and unveiling the mystery behind it.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the book binds the young age components well, with fair share of bets, pranks, parties and hangout sessions. This might not be an extreme and emotionally connecting read, but nonetheless one is bound to get attached to the characters. A well plotted, carefully crafted and openly written work by Green in his first attempt and definitely deserves a read. Anyone who has loved ' The Fault in Our Stars' by him, should give this one a go.",

That's the way history is written.\\u201d \r\n- Artemis Fowl the second\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if a juvenile genius with one of the highest recorded IQ starts believing in the fairy folk? And not stopping there, what would happen if he thinks of kidnapping one for a heavy ransom?\r\nBAM! Artemis Fowl is the kind of book that keeps you hooked till the end. There are plot twists within plot twists, a fair amount of planning, and the story flows at a good pace. If we had to recommend a book to make teenagers know about an antihero, we would recommend this. Artemis Fowl isn\\u2019t just your typical mastermind; to know what we are trying to say, you will have to dig into the book.\r\nWhat works as an ace in the hole about the book is that the protagonist isn\\u2019t the classical chosen one. Instead, he builds up his plans neatly, one on top of another while the fairies try to outsmart him. Think about Ocean\\u2019s 11, but with fairies this time. Sometimes the plans fail, and sometimes they don\\u2019t. Up till the end, you\\u2019ll just be guessing about Artemis\\u2019 mental ability; is he really a genius or just a lunatic?\r\nThe way Colfer develops the characters is a little complex, and that is what makes this fun to read. Artemis is way deeper and complex than your regular middle-grade hero. Couple this up with a fun and colourful underworld full of intelligent centaurs, gnomes and other supernatural things, and you'll get a fun read that is bound to keep you entertained for hours.\r\nThis book is a must-read for the youngest readers (although it is thrilling enough to compel the older audience too). The violence is not over the top and feels cartoonish sometimes. As the series goes on, the plot becomes darker, but nonetheless, Colfer does his best to make it family-friendly. All in all, Artemis Fowl is one book which can be read in one go. And if this isn\\u2019t enough, there are sequels too. So, be ready for hours of a good, catchy thriller, all because a genius started to believe in the fairies.\r\n\r\nSo, is Artemis a genius? Or just a lunatic? Read this book to find out!!",

You can't reduce me to a set of influences.\\u201d  ~Hannibal Lecter.  \r\n\r\nRatings: 3.7/5            \r\n    \r\nWho has not heard about \\u2018Hannibal the cannibal\\u2019, undoubtedly the most notorious and sought-after fictional villain of the 20th century with numerous book and movie adaptations about and around him? He is seen in a pivotal role in the book \\u201cThe silence of the lambs\\u201d by Thomas Harris after the previous two installments about the raw villain, Red Dragon, and Black Death. What makes this one more interesting is the presence of two sociopaths instead of just one, one being the aforementioned psychiatrist and the other is the serial killer on the loose, with some major, mommy issues and a thirst for literally wearing someone else\\u2019s skin. Though he is no Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill is no better, kidnapping and killing all female victims for their skin, with which he intends to make a dress for himself. On the other side, we have young FBI agent Sterling, who is tasked to get information about the killer from Doctor Hannibal Lecter, from his jail cell, which comes at a very personal cost indeed. The killer in the novel seems to be an amalgamation of a few real life serial killers, like Ed Gein, who used to make \\u2018ornaments\\u2019 and other household items from the skin of the corpses. Another inspiration for the character might have been Ted Bundy, America's most notorious serial.   \r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, one of the most nail biting thrillers of modern times, this book upholds a rather interesting quote by Dean Koontz, \\u201cEvil is no faceless stranger, living in a distant neighborhood. Evil has a wholesome, hometown face, with merry eyes and an open smile. Evil walks among us, wearing a mask that looks like all our faces.\\u201d Which is proved time and again in how buffalo bill seduced unsuspecting women or how a cannibal was a celebrated and successful doctor. Other themes include mental health awareness, gender roles and manipulation. In the end, this book is definitely recommended even if one has watched the motion picture. Nothing can beat that immaculate climax and the ultimate fate of Hannibal and Sterling as well to some extent. And remember when you do put down the book to go to sleep, sleep deeply and sweetly in the silence of the lambs.",

So chin up and carry on because courage isn\\u2019t having the strength to go on \\u2013 it is going on when you don\\u2019t have strength.",

      "body": "If you are born into a Bengali family, then no article, song or movie is needed to understand the intricately sewn relation between a Bengali and mahalaya and how our senses become heightened when we listen to the soulful voice of Birendra Krishna Bhadra at the wee hours of the morning, telling the story of goddess of power herself. This auspicious day marks the end of pithri paksha and the beginning of Devi paksha. This is the day when the Devi is believed to have descended upon the earth while she welcomes her daughter in the warmest way, with clear blue skies and kash-phool underneath the various hues of white and blue, mixed with the scent of shiuli-phool, homecoming and lots of love.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is closely related to mahalaya is Mahishasura Mardini- a collection of shlokas telling the story of the victory of goddess Durga over the evil Mahishashura. Listening to this program on the radio is as important a tradition as any other related to Durga Puja. Mahalaya marks the beginning of the Puja and this program, even after numerous television shows and enactments is as special and auspicious as it was when it was released the first time. The Mahishashura Mardini shloka is intimately associated with this day. The story of the buffalo king who was defiant of even the gods and tried to control the entire universe. With a blessing from the universe creator Brahma himself, that no man can defeat him, he became unstoppable. Until goddess Durga, a woman defeated him. The legend talks about \\u2018nari shakti\\u2019, and how no one is ever all-powerful.\r\n\r\nMahalaya not only signifies the homecoming of goddess Durga but of friends and family as well. The cousins from abroad, the friends from their colleges afar, all come back, just like the goddess. Starting from your neighbor next door to the celebrities we follow on Instagram, everyone is sending out the good wishes and good thoughts on Subho mahalaya. Tarpan is also performed on this day to pay respect to the ancestors and a small Puja is performed is not only a day or a tithi, but it\\u2019s also an emotion, and when one hears the hymns of \\u2018 Roopam dehi jayam dehi yasho dehi dwisho jahi\\u2019, we know it\\u2019s time to come home. Ma Durga is coming home, everyone is coming home.",

      "body": "Name of the game: Metal Gear Rising - REVENGEANCE\r\n\r\nCan you run it?\r\nThis game is designed to take a chunk out of your GPU, so better be prepared lest your gaming rig will become an air fryer. The basic requirements are\r\n\\u2022 OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1/Windows 8 (64-bit versions)\r\n\\u2022 Processor: Intel Core i5 2400\r\n\\u2022 Graphics: NVidia GeForce GTS 450 or AMD Radeon HD 5670\r\n\\u2022 System Memory: 2 GB RAM\r\n\\u2022 Storage: 25 GB Hard drive space\r\n\\u2022 DirectX 9 Compatible Graphics Card\r\n\r\nSynopsis:\r\nWitness the high octane action as the metal ninja Raiden embarks on a mission to save the world from an evil lurking within the government.  \r\n\r\nGameplay analysis:\r\nThe hack and slash it is, the game delivers BIG. Parrying system dedicated to timing, slo-mo blade mode, or the jump slash mechanics, the game has it all. There are parts where it basks in full glory, the blade mode and Jack the Ripper mode being some of them. The former sets the character in a bullet-time mode so you can skewer the enemy with a thousand cuts with your 'hf blade' and the latter, as the name suggests, is a deranged mode where everything is larger than life.\r\n\r\nWhile the zandatsu is inventive, the lock-on system is not, being useful in one on one battles, the lock-on fails in groups as they move too quickly to even get locked on, making it utterly useless.\r\nThe gameplay never feels forced and flows beautifully, the true essence being in the swords slashing with bodies. This creates a different type of aesthetic that most games fail to achieve, being a win-win for the game.\r\n\r\nStory Analysis:\r\nIt seems that developers focused too much on 'hack and slash', compromising on the story part. Not the usual storyline, but nothing worth mentioning either, crisp and short cutscenes are what make it even more gritty. Most of the flashbacks being over in less than a minute or two is what keeps the game going.\r\nBeing a bit lenient with the story paved the way for characters development, especially Jetstream Sam. The climax, yes, it could have been crisper and feels stretched at times but hey, we aren't complaining. After all, who wouldn\\u2019t love to pound a 1000 tonne mega-machine whilst delivering a lecture on politics and war.\r\nAll in all, the story front is a bit lackluster compared to the game\\u2019s essence, but it does what a story needs to \\u2013 provide an incentive to continue the game and see through its bitter end.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\nSwinging the blade of Raiden, aka Jack the Ripper will make you realize the true potential of a sword. Refined mechanics and graphics ahead of their time will make your game a pleasing affair, besides, there is very little room for flaws when a cyborg cuts almost everything with his blade. Just put up with the requirements and strap in for a show that is worth many times its price and has incredible replay value.",

The cliche of them fighting against evil, wear attractive costumes, have superhuman strengths and god-like powers provides us enough reason to idolize and love them. Be them in comic books, television screens, meme templates or on a PVR screen. One of those many superheroes is the character of Spider-Man. A comic book character that first appeared in 1962 and was introduced on big screens in 2002. Since then numerous movies and animated shows were aired.\r\n\r\nThrough the years we've seen the character being played by different star-casts. The spiderman trilogy had a different cast and the amazing spiderman series stared a different cast. This was a result of the conflicts between Sony Pictures Entertainment and its partnership franchise. In February 2015, good news came with the announcement of the inclusion of Spiderman in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Until then the MCU had already set its root deep within the ground and was a force to reckon with. The announcement by Sony and Disney was like icing on the cake for the Marvel fanatics. Spiderman then appeared in five MCU movies and went on to become the ruler of every fanatic hearts. The father-son bond between Ironman and Spiderman won everyone's heart. We all thought that the character would become the new leader of the Avengers. But, eventually, Sony broke its contract with Disney and SpiderMan was descended from MCU. This came as a heartbreak to all the fans. Netizens flooded social media with hashtags of bringing Spiderman back in the MCU.\r\n\r\nIn response, the grief didn't last long. On September 27, 2019, Spiderman was brought back in the MCU with the strike of the new deal between the franchises. We are all thrilled to see how the journey of Spiderman will unfold in the years to come.",

      "body": "One of the most famous Indian festivals, Durga Puja or Dussehra, is celebrated in the honor of Goddess Durga during the period of Navratri. Durga Puja celebrates the victory of Goddess Durga over the demon king Mahisasura. The culturally diverse population of India acknowledges this festival elegantly in individual ways, varying from place to place.\r\n\r\nDevotees celebrate the Navratri festival in Gujarat by observing fasts and performing the famous traditional dance Garba. Tamilians worship the three Goddesses: Durga, Saraswati, and Lakshmi during the last three days of the Navratri. Daily jagrans are held in temples during the nine holy nights in Punjab. In Maharashtra, the mulgis and manus hit the celebration grounds in festive Garba and dandiya sticks to sway on the beats of foot-thumping music. Apart from offering special worship to the Goddess in holy shrines, the locals set up a temporary altar of the deity and recite the scripture Durga Saptshati. Grand pandals are set up in different themes every year in West Bengal to enshrine beautiful idols of Goddesses.\r\n\r\nThe celebrations end with Vijay Dashami, the tenth day of Dussehra, when amid loud chants and drum beats, idols are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed. The message of Durga Puja is to burn the evil within ourselves and follow the path of virtue and goodness.\r\n\r\nWe, at The HIT Times, wish for the good health and fortune of everyone. May this Durga Puja bring home glee and joy, and gift fervor grip to one and all.",

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or better known as Mahatama Gandhi was born on 2nd October 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat. He began his life working as a lawyer but, his acute fear of public speaking made him flee from the court. Later, he overcame his fear and turned it into an advantage for himself and for the nation as well. He then began a life that went on to inspire millions. He first developed his proficiency at leadership while in South Africa where he campaigned for civil rights of the countrymen. At the age of 45, he came to India and inspired peasants, farmers and urban laborers to protest again high-taxes. It took no time for the people to identify him as their leader. People believed that his path of Non-Violence would help them gain Swaraj. He was able to help his country and countrymen gain independence from the Britishers. He met his demise on 30th January 1948 when he was shot dead by Nathuram Godse. Today, he is revered as one of the most transformative and inspirational figures around the world. He is known for his unwavering campaign and promotion of Non-Violence. The day is also celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence.\r\n\r\nToday, on his 150th Birth Anniversary, The HIT Times celebrates the man who inspired millions to follow his path and changed the world for better.",

In many areas the electricity supply has also been cut off due to the flood, causing a lot of trouble to the locals.\r\n\r\nTill now more than 55 people have lost their lives in this flood but the government is continuously organizing rescue operations owing to which more than ten thousand people have been evacuated safely to the relief camps across the state.

The water is also being continuously pumped out of the residential areas so as to prevent the outbreak of any disease. The center has announced a fund of \\u20b9400 crores to Bihar as assistance to overcome this disastrous calamity.\r\n\r\nSDRF, NDRF, and many other aid agencies are working day and night to bring the situation under control. So let us all pray for our brothers and sisters from Bihar and extend a hand of help to all those affected.",

To put it in a less confusing way, Super M is a supergroup. Supergroups are nothing new. In older days, it was often seen that members from different rock bands would come together to create new dynamics and find out other possible alternatives to the existing music industry, and it was time this trend found its way into the kpop industry.\r\nSuper M consists of members from Exo (Byun Baekhyun and Kai), NCT (Taeyong, Ten, Mark and Lucas) and SHinee (Lee Taemin), which are all established idols in the Kpop industry.\r\nThe group was announced back on August 7, 2019, at Capitol Congress. CMG chairman and CEO Steve Barnett, Caroline president Jacqueline Saturn, and SM founder Soo-Man Lee were all on hand to share words about the announcement. The group which was announced as \\u201cThe Avengers of Kpop\\u201d were introduced in crisp and futuristic visuals, with the youngest member Mark rocking a big pair of clear sunglasses. \"We're maintaining their groups, their solo careers, and on top of this, we have this 'Avengers' group to pull them together. There's already an Iron-Man, a Thor, etc; and just like how the Avengers can have their own successful movies, there is a different kind of energy when they are together as The Avengers. We are now creating that as a point of business. We want to create a synergy between their groups, them as solo acts, and the Super M group to create a big wave in this K-pop industry.\" Quoted Chris Lee, A&R executive at Super M. Intensive advertising was done, with visuals (both individual and group) introduced on various social platforms. Teasers of each individual member, a dance routine accompanied by group teasers.\r\nSuper M dropped their eponymous ep on October 4th, with their lead title \\u201cJopping\\u201d garnering over 17 million views days after release, even going trending in India.\r\nTruly, there were some hitches during their premiere with the hashtag \\u2018#supermdisbandmentparty\\u2019 trending on twitter but all is well that ends well. When performing at Capitol Records, they truly showed that they were a force to be reckoned with, their stage presence, singing, dancing, and visuals being top-notch.\r\nSuper M have debuted on a very big scale, showing us that when the established idols, each having their own loyal fandom come together. The result is something far more exciting.",

A sense of triumph stretched across the country as Indian-origin Abhijeet Banerjee won the Nobel Prize in Economics for work on Global Poverty. Alongside Banerjee, his wife Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer shared the prize.\r\n\r\nAbhijeet Banerjee completed his education from the University of Calcutta, Jawaharlal Nehru University and then went on to receive a Ph.D. degree from Harvard University. The joint effort by the three laureates was \"The experimental approach to alleviate global poverty\". The Indian-American economist is currently a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with his wife Duflo. Esther Duflo became the second female winner and the youngest ever. Duflo has also served as an advisor to former US President Barack Obama. Michael Kremer, a professor at Harvard University, conducted pioneering work with Kenyan School during the 1990s. This effort was further developed by Duflo and Banerjee. Their combined effort on how to raise vaccination rates and education standards touched millions of hearts across the globe. They received worldwide recognition and were praised for this.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer along with all other laureates' on winning the Nobel prize in their respective fields and on attaining a life-changing honor.

They now have cellular phones and devices that tell them the time. I consider technology is not really a necessity for a child. The overall development of a child has been affected adversely due to this. Parents presume it's quite safe to use cell phones and other electronic gadgets in order to get rid of their child's troubles.\r\n\r\nEarlier, children wouldn't be complaining about much. Perhaps, the main thing that sets our childhood apart is that, while we may have done some of the same things, those memories live inside our minds and in countless photo albums stored in our parents\\u2019 living room, not on social media.\r\n\r\nPic Courtesy: The Internet",

As per local records, 77 were confirmed dead, and 10 were missing, with a property loss of around $9 billion. Hagibis caused widespread damage across Japan, particularly in the Kant\\u014d region.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth named typhoon, Hagibis developed over a tropical wave, located a couple of hundred miles north of the Marshall Islands around the first week of October. It was a very large and powerful cyclone, that was considered the largest to hit the Kanto region after Ida hit back in 1958. Hagibis added to the losses of Flexis that hit Japan just a month prior.\r\n\r\nHagibis brought along with it heavy rain and winds, flooded rivers, collapsed dikes, and numerous landslides. More than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan had burst their banks, flooding more than 1,000 homes in cities, towns, and villages.\r\n\r\nMore than 100,000 rescue workers are still combing through flooded and damaged areas of central Japan after it was struck by Hagibis.\r\nClimate studies suggest japan could see more frequent and stronger typhoons in the future, due in large part to warming seas as a result of human-caused global warming. The losses were unusually high this time, considering Japan is one of the most well-prepared countries regarding natural disasters.

The next day they worked on a plethora of other tools like color, imgurl, about section to name a few. The last day had a lot in store for the students. From introducing PHP to using xampp database and then imgurling it to the login page. Last but not least, a quiz was held to test the grey cells of the apprentices. The workshop was brought to a halt by distributing the certificates among the students. Have an insight into the workshop here!",

      "body": "Far from the maddening crowd, there lies a land with the fiery sky and the serene waters. Life as we know it, is a mayhem of events, of moments, floating around and crashing onto one another. And in this chaos of intricately knit beauty and madness, we are defined by those fleeting moments. Often, as human beings we like to wallow in our pool of self pity and sorrow, or immerse into the quicksand of fear, or paralyze ourselves with the horror of the unknown and the overthinking that quickly follows when faced with events of harsh magnitude; the truth being, our reality lies in the space between the black and white. What we fail to realize is that it is the uncertainty, the bittersweet wait of the very next moment, that gives our existence the much desired meaning, which we spent an eternity trying to find. And in this maze of wavering actuality, we are defined by the choices that we make. If it's the red horned rascal that wins or the one dressed in white, dripping with innocence. Nonetheless, as the most evolved species of the universe, we do find out if we are capable of making a choice to meet our peace and through it walk down the path of contentment or we let ourselves drown in our insecurities again and again. But, at the end of the day, when our bodies finally meet the comforts of a cozy bed and the familiarity of a rebel mind, we realize that there exist no wrong roads, for we are only human- a struggling spirit caught in the eternal play of the fiery sky and the serene waters.",

      "body": "A simple parking row between police personnel and lawyers on Saturday had escalated leading to violence and arson at the Tis Hazari Court complex. At least 20 police personnel and several lawyers were injured and many vehicles were damaged in the incident. This dispute led to atleast 20 policemen and several advocates being injured.\r\nThe immediate provocation for the protest was an on-duty policeman being thrashed by advocates outside the Saket Court on Monday. When the policeman was leaving the spot, a man also hit his bike with his helmet. Since that incident the police personnel started protesting against the lawyers wearing black armbands and chanting slogans for justice. They also moved an application in the Delhi High Court against the guilty lawyers.\r\nSimilarly, the lawyers also went on a strike and staged a protest demanding action against police personnel involved in the Tis Hazari incident which saw the police personnel firing bullets leading to serious injury of a few advocates. The advocates also moved an application in the court against the police personnel demanding justice.\r\n While the Delhi High Court also expressed anguish over this situation and issued the statement stating \"they (police and lawyers) are but two faces of the coin of justice, and it is essential, for the rule of law to prevail, that they work in close proximity and harmony. Any dissonance, or friction, between them, is deleterious to peace and harmony, and destructive of public interest, in the long run.In our view, therefore, it would be advisable, in this case, that a joint meeting, of responsible representatives of the advocates and the police establishment be convened, who should make a sincere effort to meet and sort out their differences amicably and peacefully.\"",

Alike, everyone, we jot down our plans that we will merely indulge into. We commit to arbitrary actions that don't yield the desired outcome. Where do we lag? It's the approach. We do commit to the actions related to it but, we forget to adapt the lifestyle changes that it brings. We forget to orchestrate our thought process around an exclusive thing. But, that isn't our fault. We as human beings have a conscience that goes beyond any measurement. At a certain point in our life, we desire for this and the next day we desire something else. We become overly optimistic. We all need to remember that everything needs proper planning and furthermore the way it is implemented. Instead of aspiring and committing to actions we need to set achievable goals defined over a limited period of time. And then walking down a path with the lifestyle changes would enable us to be what we desire. Well, being at a place like this would give you an opportunity to reflect on your past, and the year that lies ahead.

He was lovingly called Chacha Nehru or simply Chachaji, owing to his love for children. This day is marked by the distribution of chocolates and gifts among children, while schools organize various events to commemorate the birth anniversary of Chachaji.\r\n\r\nIt is also a common practice to distribute gifts like clothes, toys, and books to orphan children on this day. Before 1964, India celebrated Children's Day on 20th November, which was observed as the Universal Children's Day by the United Nations but after Jawaharlal Nehru\\u2019s death, in 1964, it was decided en mass\\u00e9, to celebrate his birthday as \\u2018Bal Diwas\\u2019 in the country due to his love and affection towards children.\r\n\r\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru once said \"The children of today will make the India of tomorrow. The way we bring them up will determine the future of the country\". Keen on the development and education of children in the country, Pandit Nehru oversaw the establishment of some of the most prominent educational institutions in India. His vision for the development of youth played a major role in the setting up of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, or AIIMS, and the Indian Institutes of Technology.

And now, with the latest installment, the book not only follows the adult life of Danny Torrance but also a branch of old people driving around in RVs or motor homes and having children for dinner, literally. Not just any child, but the ones who \\u201cshine\\u201d, yes Danny still \\u201cshines\\u201d not as he used to, thanks to the years of drug and alcohol abuse. But now he has better control over his powers and also the \\u2018Overlook demons\\u2019, those who now mostly reside in memory. This group of old people called \\u2018True Knot\\u2019 headed by a woman called Rose to find and torture child psychics to death so they can eat their shining. (They call it \"steam\"; it's their only nourishment.) Another major character of this story is Abra Stone who is a 13 years old girl who has the best \\u2018shine\\u2019 Danny has ever come across.\r\n\r\nWe start with Danny attending an AA meeting in New Hampshire and taking up a job as a night porter in the local hospice, with a cat as his companion. He uses his \\u2018shine\\u2019 to help his patients ease their pain in their last moments accompanied by a cat, giving him the name \\u201cDoctor Sleep\\u201d. The book then focuses on the meeting between Danny and Abra who communicate first via their shine and then meet in person. Abra then tells Danny about the true knot and their true intentions, and we embark on a journey of the triumph of good over evil. The characterization of the book is obviously very nicely done, though you may not necessarily find them in their shoes, you will surely relate to their dilemmas and predicaments. The climax of the book takes us to the same place where the Overlook once stood, which surely was a touch of nostalgia for the readers.\r\n \r\nAs King himself said in the author\\u2019s note that sequels are never as good as the original and \\u201cnothing can live up to the memory of a gold scare.\\u201d, personally I feel the same. Doctor Sleep is very different from \\u201cThe Shining\\u201d, which does not necessarily mean it\\u2019s bad, but surely after finishing this book, you will want to pick up \\u201cThe Shining\\u201d once again. To relive the horror, to relive the glory.",

He cries, he laughs, he tricks, he gets tricked and much more to boot.\r\n\r\nWhen her mother gets diagnosed with a rare form of fairy disease that has a cure in a species whose last surviving member was \\u2013 wait for it, sold by Artemis to a group of extremists for money, it is all on the shoulders of Holly Short and the older Artemis to stop the younger one from selling it.\r\n\r\nWhile each and every book of the fowl series is fantastic in its own right, this one stands out the most, because hey, you get to compare the older Artemis with the younger version. And when even he says, \\u201cWas I this ruthless?\\u201d, you know it's not going to be your average cat and mouse chase; for both of them are essentially the one person known as Artemis Fowl the second.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is crisp and to the point, with the author never straying too much into the side stories, nor losing the sight of the end. It is a rollercoaster of all sorts, exactly what you would expect from an Artemis Fowl book.\r\n\r\nThe twists and turns in this one may not be for the first timers, but it sure will be a treat for the loyal fans of the series, as the criminal mastermind once again faces his old nemesis, the one who nearly had him killed in the second book, Opal Koboi.\r\n\r\nHow the little Koboi fits in all of this is what forms the crux of the story, and as a good antagonist should be, she is ruthless and calculative right down to the core.\r\n\r\nSo sit down tight for this epic right, for you have read many time travelling stories before this, but we can assure you that you will feel thoroughly satisfied when you will turn the final page.\r\nOh, and did we mention Mulch Diggums? Yes, he returns too.",

Living every day in the presence of those who refuse to acknowledge your humanity takes great courage.\\u201d  \r\nIsak to Noa(in Pachinko.)\r\n\r\nThis novel from Lee is a captivating tale of a Korean family based in Japan. The plot is stringed out as a narrative of multiple character's lives in the same timeline. This story spans around a hundred years, in Korea at the beginning of the 20th century and goes on to end in Tokyo and Yokohama. Thus, this novel is a beautiful long read and touches a very personal string through the portrayals of the struggles of people in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nA Korean woman called Sunja faces severe wrath of the society when she falls pregnant to a married man. The story follows up with Sunja's struggle for survival and her self discovery through this entire journey. However, things take a turn, when another man kindly offers her an escape from this situation by a proposition to move-in with him in Japan. But things do not get better, as even there she is exposed to social injustices and prejudices that presides for the by the Korean immigrants in Japan.\r\nThe story later proceeds to compare the norms and forms of these prejudices a generation apart as it further narrates the story of her sons. Only this time these young men find strength and courage to combat and overcome these obstacles.\r\n\r\nLee builds on the plot with relevant as well as some overlooked history of the huge Korean community present in Japan and are referred to as\\u00a0zainichi, a pseudo slang term for these Korean immigrants. The piece portrays all human emotions very naturally and Shame and guilt are the underlying tones of most of the pages in this book. Thus anyone looking for some very gripping and beautifully melancholic historical fiction, this one is absolutely the right pick for you.",

Soon they meet another vacationing German couple, Charly and Hanna, who introduce them to a band of locals\\u2014the Wolf, the Lamb, and El Quemado\\u2014and to the darker side of life in a resort town.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the story of the book seems so simple that one can only wonder what the turning point will be. Udo, accompanied by his fiancee Ingeborg, is at a turning point in his life, he intends to devote himself fully to his passion, the wargames. Many characters come to disturb the life of the couple, including the boat rental that seems to live on the beach and will prove a formidable opponent on the plateau for Udo. Little by little, the relations between them will become more complex and the hero will be very lonely. Whether it's the Spaniards, Udo's opponent, the burnt man, the bosses of the hotel or the annoying another German couple on vacation, all the people who intervene in the life of the couple do it in a theatrical way. \r\n\r\nLate one night, Charly disappears without a trace, and Udo\\u2019s well-ordered life is thrown into upheaval; while Ingeborg and Hanna return to their lives in Germany, he refuses to leave the hotel and keep searching for Charlie. Roberto Bolano juggles between reality and fantasy, the city seems to be only the scenery of the trap that closes on Udo. His relations with Germany, which are limited to brief telephone conversations with his best friend Conrad, tend to look a bit artificial. The simple holiday narrative goes from tanning chronicles to a man's fear for his life. The moist and agonizing atmosphere settles progressively well. The choice of the title of the novel that takes the name of the game disputed between the hero and the burnt suggests that the legacy of the second world war is at the heart of the novel. \r\n\r\nAt his best Bolano somehow manages to create bizarrely ominous and scary scenarios out of apparently very little. This is another clever and compelling attack on toxic people struggling to accommodate them and the oblique means of different types of necessary war. The real genius of Bolano here is his managing to weave all kinds of large themes into a novel that can easily be read as a straight thriller. Written in 1989 and found among Roberto Bola\\u00f1o\\u2019s papers after his death, The Third Reich is a stunning exploration of memory and violence. Reading this quick, visceral novel, we see a world-class writer coming into his own.",

The day of the puja is as colourful as the season of spring, with yellow being the dominating colour, most women drape in a yellow saree mostly and the men too dress up in traditional clothes to offer puja to the goddess of knowledge, wisdom, music, art, and learning. Saraswati being the goddess of beauty as well is generally decorated with white and yellow flowers, which makes the whole festival more tranquil and peaceful. In many places this day is considered holy for reaping the first mustard crops of the season as well as to mark the beginning of a little one\\u2019s education, that is, the young ones write their first words, preferably on a banana leaf. One of the reasons why the Vasant Panchami is chosen for this puja is, according to Hindu mythology, the goddess Saraswati was born on this day. Also, since she is a personification of creativeness, there is creative and holy energy associated with this day.\r\n\r\nWe believe if you were to ask someone, especially a student why this puja is so special and different than all the other ones, you might get a variety of answers but a mandatory visit to their school or college would be a given. The gaining of wisdom or knowledge may not be very apparent from the puja but the \\u2018puspannjali\\u2019 to the goddess at the wee hours of the morning in a sixteen yard or a kurta, followed by the \\u2018bhog\\u2019 and the meeting of old and new friends is very intricately woven with this festival of wisdom and knowledge.

Being an epitome of peace and moral principles people abided by him and believed that his motives and principles can gain them independence. Today, while we commemorate the assassination of Gandhiji, let's recall his ethical principles and salute to our brave fighters for presenting us to live in an independent country without the banners or chains of slavery.",

Early attempts used telescopes in orbit to detect these rays, but they were not much successful.\r\nCosmic rays travel at the speed of light and consist of protons and atomic nuclei, which upon interaction with our atmosphere produce a shower of secondary particles. The same effect is seen in the case of gamma rays too.\r\nSo to trace back to the origin of these mysterious rays, scientists observe and study the showers carefully. And that is where LHAASO comes in.\r\nSpread over a total area of 360 acres, at a height of 4410 meters above sea level, LHAASO houses three underground observation pools containing around 12 telescopes and multiple Cherenkov radiation detectors. It first started observations in 2019, but recently it discovered something very amazing.\r\nJust a few months ago, scientists observed Peta electronvolt photons or PeV Photons, which means photons that have been accelerated in a particle accelerator such that it gained an energy equivalent to accelerate an electron with an electric potential of 0.8 million billion electronvolts, in simple terms, it\\u2019s way too much energy. The source was initially considered to be somewhere in the Crab nebula, but uncertain.\r\nRight after its almost complete installation, LHASSO found almost 12 possible PeV accelerators in the Milky Way, a groundbreaking discovery in the field of Gamma astronomy.\r\nLHAASO has just begun its journey and it surely has a lot more in store for us in the times about to come.",

It is a platform where disabled athletes showcase their talents and vie for their shot at  the Olympic glory. This year's Tokyo Paralympics has seen some commendable performances from Indian athletes with their medal haul touching double figures for the first time in the history of India at the Paralympics in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nMonday 30th August will be written  in golden letters in the pages of sports history as India snagged five medals in a single day, two golds, two silver and one bronze for which it leapfrogged to 26th position in the medal table. Shooter Avani Lekhara became the first woman to bag a gold medal at the Paralympics. Lekhara had previously sustained spinal cord injuries in a car accident in 2012 but her injury could not subdue the embers of her fighting spirit as she shot a world record equalling total of 249.6 in the final setting a new Paralympic record. \"I can't describe this feeling. I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world. It's unexplainable,\" Lekhara said later, giddy with excitement. The second gold of the day was won by Sumit Antil setting a new world record thrice in one night for the F64 class gold. The 23-year-old hailing from Sonepat in Haryana was involved in a motorbike accident in 2015 where he had tragically lost his left leg below the knee. Despite this setback, he bettered his previous world record of 62.88m effectively five times on the day. His series of throws read: 66.95, 68.08, 65.27, 66.71, 68.55. The silver medals of the day came to the way of veteran Devandra Jhajharia(javelin) and youngster Yogesh Kathuniya(discus) with Sundar Singh Gurjar (javelin) securing a bronze. \r\n\r\nIndia's winning streak was not done yet as three more medals were secured on the following day-one bronze in shooting by Singhraj Adhana and two in the high jump by defending champion Mariyappan Thangavelu(silver) and Sharad Kumar(bronze).  \r\n\r\nFriday 3rd September was nothing short of extraordinary as three more medals paved it's path to India. Avani not satisfied with her gold medal, came out with guns blazing when she claimed a bronze medal at the ongoing Paralympic games. The trailblazer went on to become the first Indian woman to win two Paralympic medals. Praveen Kumar's leap over all odds fetched him a silver medal in the men's high jump T64/T44 event while Harvinder Singh channeled all his steel and grit to snag the first-ever archery bronze medal in a thrilling shoot-off against Kim Min Su of Korea. The following day Indian shooters Manish Narwal and Singhraj Adhana clinched the gold and silver medal respectively in the P4- Mixed 50m Pistol SH 1 final at Asaka Shooting Range.\r\n\r\n The hunt is still on as the 19 year old Avani Lekhara has her gun trained on the next target- the mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 event while Pramod Bhagat and Palak Kohli qualified for the para badminton mixed doubles finals.",

Kobe, his 13-year-old daughter, and an emerging basketball sensation, Gianna, ; her 13-year-old teammates Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester; their parents Keri and John Altobelli, Sarah Chester; basketball assistant coach Christina Mauser and pilot Ara Zobayan; all suffered the same appalling fate.\r\n\r\nThe helicopter crashed and caught fire in Calabasas, California, near the intersection of Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street at 9:47 a.m. (17:47 UTC). The crash occurred on a hillside behind the headquarters of the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District. The primary speculation for the cause of this accident are the bad weather conditions and extreme fogginess.

On 31st Jan the Lakers, Kobe's team, honored him in a pregame ceremony by celebrating his jersey and a speech from LeBron James himself.\r\n\r\nThis case also brought to light that how uncertain life is and how important it is to cherish every moment without holding back; how essential it is to let your loved ones know how much they mean to you before you lose the last chance to. Life is surely beautiful but also very unpredictable. It is always a blessing to safely make it to home; something which Kobe couldn't.

As the name suggests, the couples give roses to each other. It may sound exciting, but it is not, while giving roses itself isnt that much of an issue but, the people have went that extra mile to actually categorize the roses. The red one means \"lovers\" while the yellow/white one means \"friends\".\r\n\r\nSo what is the rose day about? Is it about showing affection? NOPE, it is all a scheme by flower shops to sell more flowers. Whats more, they keep more yellow roses than the red ones to make them feel rare to buy. And why rose? Why not lotus? Or jasmine?\r\n\r\nWell, the aforementioned question is even more of a mystery than the Bermuda Triangle. So happy rose day, everyone, and make sure to not mix both the red and white/yellow roses together in a bouquet. Rather than making your significant other happy, it'll make them confused which can ultimately lead to a very exhilirating situation with a sad bollywood number playing in background. Keep safe and we hope you last (well, atleast your pocket does) until the valentine's day.",

Saltlake Central Park is all decked up to experience yet another year, the 44th Kolkata International Bookfair. The theme country for this year is Russia. International Kolkata Book Fair initially began in 1976 with only 34 publishers. Eventually, it started to grow. Currently, the fair gets more than 2.5 million footfall every year. Likewise, it became an integral part of Kolkata and its culture. Many youngsters also visit the fair. People not only love to hop every stall, purchase books of their favorite author but also like to enjoy foods. Therefore many publishers prefer to release their books at the Book Fair.\r\n\r\nAlmost every book-stall will give a minimum 10% discount. Although, if you are familiar with college street, you may think to have a better discount there. Partially true, because some books either will not be available in college street soon or never. Similarly, magazines like Hangla and others give a very lucrative deal, you just can\\u2019t miss.\r\nSo hurry up get your gang and visit the KIBF from 29th January to 9the February 2020 anytime between 12 PM till 8 PM.",

So if you get a chocolate, don't get too hyped about it, maybe its just the friendship chocolate, and nothing else. And why did people even bring friendship into this seven-day long kumbh mela of lovers? Maybe they took \"pyaar dosti hai\" to heart, who knows.\r\n\r\nSpeaking about chocolates, the price at which they are sold will really make you wonder if they are made in a gold cauldron or something like that because a bar will cost you anything between 200 to 2000, which is sure to make your monthly budget go up in flames, John Wick style.\r\n\r\nSo good luck to you (your pocket, more specifically) and we hope your chocolate is a lovers one and it finds its perfect owner.",

This happens every single time, without exception. We are no different.\\u201d ~Jeffrey R. Anderson\r\n\r\nThe parallelism between the journey of the river and the journey of life is simply mind-boggling. At the very basic level, we can see how both river and life originate from seemingly nothing but goes onto become what it is, \\u2018life\\u2019. Since the very beginning of life, life and river or more specifically water were closely dependent. History stood witness of the budding of human settlements on the banks of rivers and how they blossomed into civilisations. Be it Harappa- Mohenjo Daro or the Egyptian civilisation, all were completely dependent on the river it settled around. The river meanders through curves and turns but never stops, no matter how big of a rock(obstacle) comes in its path. It is true for life as well, life always goes on, never stops, yes slows down but never stops. The flow might get disrupted but never stops. The final destination of both is similar as well, the river flows down the terrain to join the ocean and as for life, a life of an individual starts for oneself but in the end, all lives in this world works for the betterment of mankind, so the life of an individual is a river and they join together to form an ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Ecclesiastes 1:7 from The Holy Bible reads \"All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.\" That is to say that, life on earth is a never-ending cycle, one life may wither away but a new one blooms, just like how one river emptying into the sea does not make it full. Everything is interwoven into a much grander structure, the cycle of life and rivers are all but one.\r\n\r\nPic Credit: Soumyadeep Manna\r\n(19/ECE/32)",

      "body": "Name of the book- The Bell Jar\r\nAuthor- Sylvia Plath.\r\nRating- 4.6/5.0\r\nRecommended- Absolutely.\r\nWarning- Deals with mental health issues and can be triggering.\r\n\r\n\\u201cTo the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is a bad dream.\\u201d\r\n~Esther Greenwood (from \\u2018The Bell Jar\\u2019)\r\n\r\nIn a world infested of typical social norms, Esther Greenwood is an exception. Set in a backdrop of New York's Life in the 1960s, 'The Bell Jar' by Plath explores various aspects of a working woman; inclusive of dreams, expectations, reality of living, sexuality, mental health and materialistic approach to name a few. This novel is a semi-autobiographical, with a very parallel portrayal of Plath's own life. She committed suicide a month after its first UK publication.\r\n\r\nWith mental health being one of the most important themes in tow, this book was way ahead of its own generation. Throughout the novel, Esther tries to find out a way to a settling satisfaction in her life, which she time and again fails to achieve. This is a story of a young woman struggling with feelings of alienation and acceptance. Plath refers to these feelings being trapped inside a bell jar.\r\n\r\nEven though the plot development is pretty dense, Plath's humoristic way of narration makes it an easy read. The book is full of emotions, conflicts, traumas and character development. Plath delivered a powerful blow to the society on how much it affects an individual in general, on an everyday basis and how tensed up things can get if not treated with care. The book has no dramatic exaggeration and is very relatable on both ends. So, for everyone who has questioned their conflicted inner entity at some point, 'The Bell Jar' is a must-read.",

There are a lot many speculations behind the auspicious occasion of Shivratri. Some believe that on this day Lord Shiva had union with Parvati while others hypothecate the drinking of poison by Shiva which appeared during the churning of the ocean as a reason to celebrate Shivratri. All we can do is believe in the instances described in Vedas.\r\n\r\n Shiva is an embodiment of sacrifice filled with peace whose name echoes around the horizon. He is said to be the chaos and is often considered to eradicate darkness. His omniscience makes him the conqueror of death. He is said to be the destroyer of the universe and may shower havoc upon earth and heaven when he opens his third eye. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion of Shivratri let us extol his virtues and celebrate his cosmic triumphs. Salutations to the lord with the trident as his possession, to the lord who is eternal and divine. Salutations to Lord Shiva, the 'Pashupati', the 'Mahadev', the one above all. May this Shivratri enlighten you all with good health, fortune, courage to fight evil and strive to lift ourselves to new heights.",

      "body": "With the concept of global citizenship, comes the need to focus on the basics of the language English; as it is the most broadly spoken language worldwide. Thus strengthening the grammatical aspects of the language is the arena one should strive for. Some minute grammatical errors might be a deal breaker in a conversation. So today we bring you a little piece of advice on the usage of 'into' and 'in to' in the field of application.\r\n\r\nAs undistinguishable as it sounds, just that one space makes all the difference. For starters, Into\\u00a0is a\\u00a0preposition; whereas In and To can both exist\\u00a0by themselves and can be used as preposition or adverb as required. \r\n\r\nInto: In literal sense the word indicates direction. It's an action word and defines a particular movement. \r\n\r\nIn to: In this case, the 'In' defines action and the 'to' depicts the objective for the action.\r\n\r\nThe following examples might help to simplify the terms:\r\n\\u2022 She walked into the police station.\r\n\\u2022 She turned the robber in to the police authority.\r\n\r\nHopefully, today's tip helps you guys a little more in avoiding those grammar police out there. Stay tuned for more of these.",

This was a Works Progress Administration project that ran from 1935 to 1943 which involved women into bookmobiles. As thrilling as the concept sounds, given the era, it was extremely difficult for any woman to overstep the boundaries of norms set by the typical society.\r\n\r\nThe storyline portrays the life of our protagonist Alice, who gets tired of the small town stifling life, her marriage and life in general and decides to join the Pack Horse Library program under Margery O\\u2019Hare, who acts as a catalyst in liberating her free spirited self. Along with the other three women, these two embark on delivering books and literacy around the Eastern Kentucky's hills. The pages take you through the adventures and adversities they face.\r\n\r\nMoyes successfully captures the depression era and delivers a very subtle transition of values in most of the social fields, delivering a \r\nmeaning to feminism and stigmatized fields as marriage, race, and sex. All in all, this work of Jojo Moyes celebrates knowledge, learning, reading, female friendship, advancement of social standards and most importantly the triumphant love. For anyone who wants to enjoy a calm and captivating read about the tale of the traveling librarians in the beautiful rural Kentucky hills on a backdrop of the 1930s, this one's for you.",

He further went to Agra where he visited the Taj Mahal and then to New Delhi where he held official meetings.\r\nDuring the visit, Trump addressed several Indian CEO's where he spoke about various trade opportunities for Indians in America. In the meeting he also spoke about the possible strategic business partnerships that the two countries might have in store. He also finalised the defence deals worth $3 billion between the two countries under which 30 military helicopters will be procured from two American defence makers for the Indian armed forces thus finalising a very significant defense partnership before finally leaving for the USA on Tuesday.",

Needless to point out that it already has made its way to India and we have a few crucial cases at hand. Starting from the newspapers, television channels to caller tune advertisements, the Coronavirus warning issues are being sent out to the people in every possible form.\r\n\r\nThe new coronavirus, now known as Covid-19, first encountered in Wuhan, China, December 2019 has affected over 93,000 people in over 80 countries around the globe, causing over 3,000 deaths.  The worst part is that we don\\u2019t yet know how dangerous Covid-19 is, and we won\\u2019t until more data comes in. Another probable issue is that we don't know how contagious Covid-19 is. Unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus. And people with weak immunity are very prone to be a victim to this disease. The mortality rate is estimated to be around 2% till now. The WHO hasn't still referred to this as a pandemic and at least that's a relief. \r\n\r\nThe symptoms of this virus is simply pneumonic in nature. Those who have already succumbed to the situation have reportedly suffered from coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In extreme cases there were organ failure. As it is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use and the antiviral drugs we have against flu won't work. Immunity plays a great role for survival in this case. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\r\n\r\nSome of the basic measures one can take to stay unharmed includes washing hands, wearing masks, getting flu vaccines, maintaining personal hygiene and eating less under unhygienic surroundings. The origin of this virus is from animal hosts and thus human to human transmission is very possible. Thus, until the situation gets under control and we have a proper medical solution, all we can do is play safe. With global spread of this viral menace, we just hope that all of us make it out safe and sound, in best of our health.",

Hence developing a correct sense of word usage is very important to acquire. For today's segment, we are going to discuss a little about the non-interchangeable aspect of the two very confusing words, 'further' and 'farther.'\r\n\r\nYes, just the 'u' and 'a' makes all the difference. Both apply in the field of describing distance. But in a literal sense, 'farther' deals with the physical distance i.e distances that can be measured. Whereas, 'further' refers to figurative distance and strictly in a non-physical aspect. Sometimes it also defines the higher degree of something. For example, it can replace the term 'moreover' in some cases.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\\u2022 He walked farther than the last time.\r\n\\u2022 He has no further queries regarding that.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you guys found today's article useful.

The word 'Sturmfrei' easily translates to the phrase 'storm free', which might make us think of strong winds and dark weather.

As disclosed before, this is a very common situation and a little worrisome one for parents as well. In most of the cases, the house transforms into the venue for a grand house party and at times, that escalates real quick (and not in a good way.)

Jem died, but his son was riddled with the same ability. What severely horrifies him that the people around him all have the same date of death and so, he sets out to save them.\r\nThe narrative is quite unique as it tells the story from the protagonist\\u2019s point of view and this time around, there are 2 protagonists \\u2013 Adam (Jem\\u2019s son) and Sarah (a girl Adam met in the metropolitan London who is terrified of him from their first meeting). The story is paced briskly and the narrative style of telling the story from 2 viewpoints really makes it feel closer to both the leads.\r\nWhat makes this novel worth a read is that Adam and Sarah are by no means your traditional heroes; they are hurt beyond repair, are scared and have to tackle the problems which range from bullying to teenage pregnancy to the feeling of losing one\\u2019s parents, all the while trying to save the world from an impending apocalypse. The Chaos packs in several eye-opening themes in one neat package and delivers the story with quite a bang.\r\nWhile technically and chronologically a sequel, The Chaos is the kind of book that you can read even though you haven\\u2019t read the prequel because it is strong enough to stand on its own. So reach out and read this exciting tale of two damaged protagonists who are driven by their gifts (or curses) to reach out and save the people.",

Another major attraction is the Khajjiar lake, located in the very heart of the plateau provides many activities for the visitors like boating or bird watching. Every year it attracts a lot of tourists from all over India especially during the winter months when it snows. The snow clad plateau becomes a place of dreams, with its grace, peace and simply mesmerising beauty. For the rest of the year, the lush green meadows, the dense deodar trees, and the chirping birds make it equally tranquil and enthralling. Other activities include zorbing, sledging, paragliding, horse riding, and trekking as well.     \r\n      \r\nThough it is a tiny hill town, Khajjiar packs quite a punch in terms of adventure, nature, wildlife, and culture, therefore making it worth a visit while you\\u2019re vacationing in the Abode of Snow.",

During this self imposed curfew the Prime Minister requested all the citizens to stay in their homes for 14 hours and not to go out on roads unless extremely urgent. However, the medical workers, firemen and police and the people serving the nation need not follow this curfew.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister also requested all the citizens to go to their balconies at 5 PM and ring bells or clap as a gesture of appreciation and gratitude to all the doctors, nurses and other medical staffs, public transport employees and airline employees who are working around the clock to keep the country safe and also to the home delivery riders who are working tirelessly to serve the people in quarantine.\r\n\r\nThus Janata curfew is meant to encourage people to practice social distancing, keep away from the crowds and stay at home as much as possible in the coming weeks. Modi said this curfew will be a symbol of restraint and following our duty in the interest of the nation and the success of Janta Curfew and its experience will prepare the nation for future challenges.",

The 30 series, dubbed as \\u201cBest for years to come\\u201d boasted super specs like 24 gigs of VRAM and a multitude of \\u201cCuda Cores\\u201d. But for the keen eyes, the thing that never made much news was the Ampere architecture used to make the GPU itself. A successor to evergreen Turing architecture. Ampere upped the ante several times, let's take a look at some of them.\r\n\r\nWith the launch of Turing, Nvidia was already soaring sky-high, the inclusion of RT cores as well as Tensor cores made it readily available for any of the tasks, ranging from gaming to AI and workstation platforms. An NVimgurl added to the party as it made parallel GPU processing quite feasible, with imgurl speed being close to 100GBPS. It had set its claws in the gaming market with commercials and AI with its Titan series. What happened so radically that Ampere just threw it out of the window and took the crown of \\u201cbest architecture till date\\u201d?\r\n\r\nFor starters, Ampere has 8mm FinFET technology, a derivative of Samsung\\u2019s 7mm technology that ensures more power and performance. It is said to be 1.9 times powerful than Turing. The reality, however, seems to be different. With a little over 45 percent increase, it lets down on its word but boy oh boy, the difference is visible even to the naked eye. While Turing bowed out at 4k PC, GPUs made with it can run on well above 80 fps.\r\n\r\nBut all is not merry, Ampere-based GPUs draw power like electro eating out the transformers (or at least that\\u2019s what it seems when compared to some of the older generations). But keeping the power-hunger aside, the Ampere architecture might be Nvidia\\u2019s answer to everything, at least for now.",

That's exactly how I felt when I had to leave home and come to Haldia Institute of Technology. We met confusing new faces on our first day and eventually made a home out of them. As a student myself, I can say on everyone's behalf that the entire duration of our college life wasn't a bed of roses. Sometimes it was tough, sometimes it was scary and sometimes it was devastating but at other times, it was so amazing.\\u00a0 Yes, we didn't get KJo's picture-perfect college life, but we got our jamming sessions, our addas at theks, our gossips at 1 in the morning, our scolding from seniors, our ' treat dijiye bhaiya/didi' from our juniors, and so much more. And we had all of that in just 3.5 years. Isn't that incredible? A lifetime of experiences caught in the space of just a few years.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we didn't get the farewell that we wanted, we didn't get to have our legendary pink shirts signed. The vibrant black and blue ink highlighted on a light pink background was the only pro for that uniform.\\u00a0 But we missed that too. We also couldn't hug our best friends and ask them not to cry when we were drowning in a puddle of our own tears. We said our goodbyes long before it was time. But life doesn't work that way. It just doesn't give us disappointments; it also gives us silver linings.\\u00a0 What's our silver lining you ask? We got to find out that long-distance actually works. We found out who truly were our friends all along. We got to find out the people who would stick around for hours on the phone to catch up on our lives. We found friends whom even school buddies can't beat.\r\n\r\nThe journey has finally come to an end. The optimism ends here. Times are tough and some of us are stepping into a life of uncertainty and hardships. However, hardships make us tough and maybe a little cynical. But it doesn't matter much because, in the long run, we all find the lanes that we wish to walk. Some of us on the other hand, are gearing up to conquer new jobs and nail new degrees. The best wishes are reserved for everyone. May we all be successful in our endeavours and above all learn to be happy in life.\r\n\r\nWhen we outgrow a place, all we want to do is to leave. However, when the time comes, all we want to do is to linger behind just a little longer. That's exactly  how I feel while I am about to end my journey here at HIT. I am sure all our hearts are breaking to finally say it out loud, but\r\nAdios Haldia Institute of Technology!",

The timings Of the celebration may vary across different countries depending upon the sighting of the crescent moon. \r\n\r\nEid al-Adha lasts for three days and concludes the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca made by the Islamic devotees. This festival commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience and dedication to Allah. According to the holy Quran, a voice from heaven asked Ibrahim to make something else as a great sacrifice and a ram was slaughtered in place of his son. Ever since then, people re-enact Ibrahim's obedience and consider cattle sacrifice to be a major part of Eid al-Adha celebrations. Devotees offer Eid al-Adha namaaz at the mosques any time after the sun completely rises before entering Zuha time.\r\n\r\nAfter the prayers, people embrace and exchange greetings with each other. Everyone wearing their best clothes gather with family and friends for the feast. Traditionally, the delicious meat prepared is divided into three parts- one for the family, one for the poor and needy, and the last for the guests. Giving charity to the poor and needy is also considered an important tradition of Eid al-Adha celebrations. This festival thus teaches us the lessons of devotion, sacrifice, and helping others in need.\r\n\r\nThe HIT Times wishes everyone Eid Mubark.",

      "body": "Spider silk is a protein fiber spun by spiders primarily for making the web and sometimes for other purposes. Often compared with steel regarding strength, the elastic and adhesive properties of spider silk as studied recently, has made it one of many biomaterials that can be utilized for suspension bridge wires, bulletproof vests, military draglines and medical adhesives.\r\n\r\nThe properties of spider silk that makes it different than other naturally forming silks include its tensile strength, elasticity, adhesive nature and thermal stability in fiber form. Each strand of spider silk comprises of thousands of nano-strands; each of 20 millionth a millimeter in diameter. Just like a tiny cable, each silk fiber is entirely composed of parallel nano-strands, which measured to be at least 1 micron long. This doesn\\u2019t sound like a lot, but is 50 times longer than their width and is capable of stretching further.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that spider silk is stronger than steel sounds too good to be true. Strength of any material is determined on the basis of several physical properties, tensile strength being one amongst them. The tensile strength of steel ranges from 0.2 to 2 Gigapascals, while the tensile strength of some spider silk is about 1 Gigapascal. The stiffness of silk, which is its ability to deform elastically when force is applied, is many times less than that of steel. Where spider silk seems to beat steel by a large margin is its density, which is almost six times less. On a per-weight basis then, silk starts to look more interesting, with the ratio of strength to density exceeding that of steel. \r\n\r\nNot being stronger than steel doesn\\u2019t make spider silk any less interesting and unique. When exposed to water, these fibers exhibit a property called super contraction and can reduce up to 50% in size. Also, water cannot weaken the strong adhesive bonds which only dissolves at high pH. Elastic properties of spider steel allow it to be stretched 4 times its length without breaking and can retain these properties at temperatures as low as \\u201340\\u02da Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nScientists are still working towards the commercial artificial production spider silk as it is primarily governed by the genome of the spider concerned hence making the silk of every spider species a bit different than the other one. Nonetheless, it\\u2019ll always be a \\u2018wonder-fiber\\u2019, providing the prospect for several bio-engineering based projects.",

Gender is a mere societal construct which is used to segregate people into two groups based on their birth sex. Gender identity and sex are two very different things. A person may be born as XY but can transition into a female or choose to be non-binary, unlabeled or remain a cis-gender male. \r\nYour Gender Identity does not equate to what you were born as, it equates to how you feel comfortable in your own body. \r\nThat being said, what exactly is non-Binary as a gender identity? Strictly speaking, it could be anything. Most people who feel that they identify neither as a female nor a male conform to this label. It could also be those who feel like they can identify as both male and female and can choose to express it either way based on their comfort.\r\nThere exists a very stereotypical depiction of genders- Women are more docile and sensitive and look a certain way with long hair and other such descriptions, Men are seen as more strong, straight body and short hair and more. \r\nThere is no certain way to look any gender and similarly, non-Binary people don\\u2019t look more masculine or more feminine, they ARE non-binary and that should be respected. Being non-binary should not be equated with nonconforming clothing and style as wearing a dress doesn\\u2019t make you a woman and wearing trousers doesn\\u2019t make you a man.\r\nThese labels and descriptions often confuse people and lead them to struggle with their identities. You don\\u2019t have to conform to a type or category of people to fit into the society, this is not a vegetable market where you can be neatly stacked up into little piles. \r\nLikewise, Non-Binary people are mostly unlabeled people who either feel comfortable expressing themselves in many ways than one or as neither. It is not a trend, this identity has existed in cultured for centuries. They don\\u2019t need to explain their identity to people, it\\u2019s time people respect them for who they are.",

Only when they are back home, do they come up with a lot of great comebacks. People who experience esprit d'escalier are said to have a \"staircase wit\". The phrase \"staircase wit\" kind of makes sense, especially when one imagines a spiral staircase. In the midst of a discussion, the ideas which they wants to express can seem to spiral up and out of their consciousness similar to that of a spiral staircase.

      "body": "Lotus Effect\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered how the surface of a lotus leaf never gets wet and always seem to appear clean despite of growing in muddy areas? Scientists pondered upon these questions too and found out that the self-cleaning properties as exhibited by the lotus leaf and some other insects is due to a phenomenon that was named \\u201cLotus Effect\\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe term Lotus Effect refers to the self-cleaning properties that are a result of ultra-hydrophobicity (also called super-hydrophobicity) as exhibited by the leaves of Lotus.\r\n\r\nUpon studying the chemical composition and topography of the lotus leaves, scientists found that the leaves had two levels of structures that explained this behavior: a microstructure level consisting of surface lumps and a nanostructure level formed by small hairs. Both systems were constituted by a waxy coating, which together made the surface of a lotus leaf repel water and gave it its characteristic ultra-hydrophobic nature. Plants with a double structured surface like the lotus can reach a contact angle of 170\\u00b0 for fluids, whereby the droplet's contact area is only 0.6%. Dirt particles with an extremely reduced contact area are picked up by water droplets and are thus easily cleaned off the surface. All this leads to a self-cleaning effect.\r\n\r\nUnlike hydrophobicity which is a chemical property, ultra-hydrophobicity is fundamentally a physical property thus providing a vast opportunity to scientists to mimic an artificial surface constituting of similar properties. There are several possible interesting applications like developments of paints to prevent corrosion. Due to its extreme water-resistant quality, nanotechnological ultra-hydrophobic solution developed to mimic the surface of lotus leaf is widely being used on glass and windshields which guarantees visibility in every weather condition and also as an insulator in electrical equipment. This effect is also useful in producing anti-bacterial surfaces.\r\n\r\nLotus effect proposes nanotechnology products with molecular activity and solutions will high technological value in several sectors; from transport to biomedical. All it needs is a closer look in simple things around us!",

      "body": "Initially regarded as an all-male domain, the arena of the Olympics was globally kept, well out of reach for all women athletes. They were looked down upon as delicate and fragile beings. But, over the years, they have fought vigorously to break this so-called notion that \"Women are the weaker sex\". And now it's not the men but the women who are taking the Olympic world by storm. \r\n\r\nIndian star weightlifter Mirabai Chanu created history on 24th July to become the first Indian weightlifter to bag the silver medal on the very first day of the Olympic Games. Chanu lifted 87 kg in snatch and the clean and jerk segment. She hoisted 115 kg successfully which, set a new Olympic record. From picking woods in the jungle to winning an Olympic silver, Mirabai has come a long way to become a champion. \r\n\r\nAced badminton player PV Sindhu wrote her name in the pages of history on 1st August, right after she scored a scintillating win against He Bingjiao of China and secured a bronze medal for India. With this win and the silver earned at the previous Games in Rio de Janeiro, Sindhu then went on to become the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals. Reeling from the semi-final loss on Saturday to Tai Tzu-Ying, Sindhu becomes even more driven to seize the one medal at all costs. And this showed in this Hyderbadi's play as she crafted the contest's template as her efforts bore fruit eventually. \r\n\r\nThere's another superwoman on the list whose name is worth mentioning. Lovlina Borgohain scripted history on 4th August by signing off with a bronze medal in the Tokyo Olympics to become the third Indian boxer to claim bronze after Vijender Singh(2008) and M.C. Mary Kom(2012). Before going down against Busenaz Surmeneli, she fought with a tenacity and determination which will continue to inspire many young Indians in the years to come. \r\n\r\nThis Tokyo Olympics 2020 will be memorable for its remarkable displays of women autonomy. Mirabai Chanu, PV Sindhu and Lovlina Borgohain will become the epitome of what women can achieve and the heights of excellence they can reach. Their performances will call on all women to challenge gender stereotypes, encourage them to break these social norms and keep pursuing their dreams.",

The player enters the game as a member of Paranormal Activity Helper Incorporated in a house over 100 years old to see whether it is haunted. The ghost, our antagonist, can switch between normal and evil mode. In the evil mode, it can transform the player into a doll and the player has to run from this. In the house are two kinds of dolls; marked and coloured. Of these, only nine marked dolls can move, and the player has to burn all of them to reach the end. The player needs to pick up props like keys and dolls to proceed through the game. The 5 keys open 5 doors, including the main door. The evil gets faster and smarter with the game, and once 8 of the nine marked dolls are burnt, the girl will never return to normal mode.\r\n\r\nPlot Analysis\r\nThe player enters an antique house as a PAH member which a broker wants to sell. The player has to see whether the rumors of it being haunted are true or not.  And that is almost giving away all of it. The plot is simple, ending in two or three trials. A series of clues/notes tell the story behind the girl living in this house. Adopted as means to hold talks with a dead through dolls, some mishaps led to Emilia killing her mother and putting the entire family in danger. The story has ample time to mature and by the time it nears its end, you start to sympathize with the girl and all the hardships she had to bear. A good motive, a solid backstory, some basic elements and boom, you have a plot that can keep you engaged until you complete the game.\r\n\r\nTL; DR\r\nPacify is all about entering a haunted house, finding and burning some dolls to \\u201cpacify\\u201d the ghost living in there. Rather simple with a hint of spookiness! So, why wait? Join the PAH now!",

In a teary press conference, Messi explained his desire to stay was strong and has even agreed to cut down fifty percent of his fee, but as fate would have it, the club had to let go of him due to financial fair play rules.\r\nThis was a decision that a lot of fans did not see coming and the heartbreak was expressed over all platforms. Moreover, F.C. Barcelona is expected to make a loss of around 450 million Euros in merchandise sales and sponsorships due to Messi leaving the Catalan Club.\r\nMessi has now joined the French team Paris Saint-Germain under a two-year contract with an option for a one-year extension. He will now join former Barca teammate Neymar Jr. and trade his iconic number 10 jersey for a new number 30 navy blue jersey. Neymar played a key role in convincing Messi to join PSG.\r\nHe will also share the PSG squad with fellow Argentinian players Angel Di Maria, Leandro Paredes, and Mauro Icardi. This sudden change will take time to settle in with a lot of people because Messi has always been a One Club Man and the position of Messi in Barca had taken an iconic spot in football history.\r\nNow begins a new journey for Lionel Messi and his new partnership with PSG.

Weapons are accurate and extremely deadly putting an emphasis on teamwork. Most of the game modes here do not feature instant respawn. Instead, on death, the players are left with no option other than spectating and waiting for their team to complete an objective in order to respawn. But with the addition of fire support, a player progression system, character customization, cosmetic unlocks, larger maps and drivable technical, it surely stands out from all its series predecessors. It provides the players with a handful of options in the game mode and a wide range of alms to chose from during the course of the game.\r\n\r\nStory Analysis: \r\nIt doesn't have much of a story. The entire game is based on conflicts between two factions- \"Security\", loosely based on various world militaries and \"Insurgents\", loosely based on various militant groups.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: \r\nShoot and fight with deadly armaments against militant groups in this game but be sure not to drop your guard. Once dead, your respawn totally depends on your teammates. So be ready for the adrenaline rush once you log on to this super realistic game.",

Yet the fear isn\\u2019t completely over.\r\nIn 1986, just after the explosion, liquidators constructed a sarcophagus over the ruins of the destroyed reactor. That was supposed to be a temporary solution; only meant to keep all the fuel and the radiation within for about 30 years. The sarcophagus made of steel and concrete failed to stand the test of time and started degrading and developing leaks that led in rainwater to underground chamber inaccessible since the explosion. In 2016, the New Safe Confinement was placed over the sarcophagus sealing all the radioactive waste within it for the next decade. As much as this sounds promising, the reality is a lot complex than this.\r\nThe rainwater that managed to enter the inaccessible rooms of the reactor basement have so far acted as the moderator slowing down neutrons hence keeping the rate of fission rather low. But with the new structure in place and the remaining water drying out to reach a critical level, fission reactions are spiking in these chambers, especially in a basement room 305/2.\r\nAlthough the reactions spiking in these rooms are not alarmingly high to generate enough energy for another nuclear explosion, the situation is still a matter of grave concern. Scientists are not fully ruling out the possibility of another accident. The rate of neutron emission in room 305/2 has doubled since 2016 and if it continues to increase at such a high pace, scientists may have to intervene. This might involve using robots to drill holes and install solid neutron absorbers like boron cylinders which act like control cylinders and soak up excess neutron to choke the nuclear reaction.\r\nTo prevent any further mishap, the government of Ukraine aims to remove the waste and store it in a geological repository by September.",

Safety should be a concern, but educational well-being cannot get sidelined either.\r\nVaccinations, sanitization, wearing masks, and all other safety protocols followed at different workspaces can also be used at schools. Thus, allowing students to gain the most with least to lose.\r\nTo allow the holes to be filled properly, every aspect needs to be worked properly. And to make that possible UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank have partnered in an initiative called Mission: Recovering Education 2021, to support governments get both their education system and the students back on track.",

They blamed a certain Om Prakash Mishra. New Zealand's decision to call off the tour of Pakistan came as a big setback to the cricket-crazy nation. It was to be conducted from September 17 and would have been the first international assignment in Pakistan since 2004.\r\n\r\nPakistan on Wednesday alleged that a threatening mail was sent to the New Zealand cricket squad from India. The Minister of Information and Broadcast of Pakistan, Fawad Chaudry narrated the chain of events at a press conference. He stated that the fake threat, launched on August 2019 from India became active on September 25. The fake post was created in the name of \"Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan\" asking the cricket squad to leave or else they will be targeted, he elaborated.\r\n\r\nContinuing his speech, the minister said the name behind all this was no one else but someone named Om Prakash Mishra who, created a fake email id \"Hamza Afridi\" and used the location of Singapore. Did the name sound familiar to you? Well! You are quite right. The owner of the crass, misogynistic \"Aunty ki ghanti\" song and the beloved memechild of the Indian meme community has the same name, and they grabbed this golden chance with both hands.\r\n\r\nSoon, the netizens took the internet by storm and flooded the social media with memes targeting PCB and crowning Om Prakash Mishra as \\u201cLord.\\u201d Unaware of what he did, he has now become trending on social media again as he (allegedly) was successful in single-handedly maneuvering Pakistan's agency and has become the reason behind the cancelation of the tour too.",

Sunaina had a troubled childhood. Her parents separated when she was quite young and thus she was quite ill-treated at school. No one wanted to be friends with her. During all those years her grandmother was her best friend. But the world ceased to exist for her after the old lady\\u2019s death. Sunaina was left with absolutely no friend or companion.  The feeling of being left alone started to reflect on the academics and her mother unaware of anything decided to change her school. That was where she met Ananya and somehow the two instantly hit off. From being mere classmates to becoming best friends it took less than a month. Sunaina was leading the best phase of her life when suddenly the thought of losing Ananya started haunting her. She couldn\\u2019t afford to lose Ananya like she lost her grandmother. One day while sharing this insecurity with Ananya she told her a word that she had come across recently. The word was \\u201cya\\u2019aburnee\\u201d. Sunaina explained her fears to Ananya and said, \\u201cFor a long time in life I was all alone and without a friend. After many \r\nyears I got you. I can\\u2019t bear to lose you Ananya! I have already lost my grandmother, another loss cannot be endured by me. Promise me that you won\\u2019t leave me alone, and you will let me die before you.\\u201d \r\nMaybe for the first time in years, God answered Sunaina\\u2019s prayers. She succumbed to an accident a few months later.",

The Scarlet dash across the blue sky, the crimson dot in midst of a green foliage peeking through, exciting giggling children with their bright magic. The flutter of wind barely noticeable yet you notice the red day shooting star as toddlers point at it in amazement. Nature\\u2019s canvas has all these vivid bright spots lurking around, we would be lucky enough to see the mad dash of the painter\\u2019s brush and when we do, we frame in our minds. For a night full of shooting stars and wishes, this is day full of bizarre and unique strokes which vanishes. But once caught, it is worth the luck of a thousand stars.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonder how nature created its own mad dash of rainbows, the little splash that lands on the palette and captivates the universe, but it is a thing of beauty indeed.\r\nBut for now, let us stare at this beauty frozen in time, a peaceful resting stroke of brush caught, a cherished and framed memory.",

      "body": "The wonders of technology never cease to amaze the world. Northwestern University engineers broke the barriers of antiquated technology by creating the smallest-ever human-made flying structure in the form of a tiny moving microchip. Taking a page from Marvel Studios \"Ant-Man\", scientists have developed this \"microflier\" to resemble the size of a grain of sand and is much smaller than a regular-sized ant. Without a motor or engine, this microflier operates by catching a flight on the wind and spinning like a helicopter through the air making one think of those propeller seeds from maple trees. Research journals talked about the interiors of the chip which is equipped with sensors, power sources, antennas for wireless communication, and even an embedded memory to store data. \r\n\r\nBy surveying the dispersal mechanism of the maple Samaras and other wind-dispersed seeds, engineers were able to optimize the microflier's aerodynamics to ensure that it falls at a slow, controlled velocity when dropped from a height. This behaviour stabilizes its flight, ensures dispersal over a broad area, and increases the amount of time it interacts with the air, making it ideal for monitoring air pollution and airborne diseases.\r\n\r\nThe framework of this winged contraption is inspired by the shape of the tristellateia, a flowing vine with star-shaped seeds.\" We think we beat nature,\" said John Rogers, who lead the device's development, referring to the microflier's ability to descend more sedately and stably than the seeds of the same size falling from trees. \" We were also able to build these 'helicopter' flying structures at sizes much smaller than those found in nature.\" he further added. This was extremely important owing to the growing frenzy over increasingly smaller devices in the electronics industry.",

But time does make things change, even the strongest of all beliefs are bound to shake when it comes to the probabilities in the future.\r\nRonaldo had already withdrawn from Real Madrid a couple of seasons back and recently Messi left F.C. Barcelona for Paris Saint-German(PSG). With the withdrawal of both the titans, a lot of possible outcomes have occupied the minds of the other footballers, critics, netizens, and the public in general. But as stated with professional judgments, El Classico was and will always be superior to any single player. Both the clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona have a very rich history dating back more than a century. The thrill and rivalry between the clubs and not to mention the supporters have never seen a downfall, be it the age before the two or during their era.\r\nThough it is evident that the hardcore Messi-Ronaldo fans were a bit damped, however when it comes to football, they are the first ones to grab a seat in front of the nearest available communication system. The new flag bearers have a major role to play in this regard. People worldwide are looking forward to the new jersey 10 of Barcelona, Ansu as well as Memphis, who will be playing his first-ever El Classico this session.\r\nFootballers come and go but what remains is nothing but \"Football\" itself. The fire that was once kindled between Barcelona and Real Madrid will always be the same irrespective of the circumstances. So? Real Madrid or Barcelona whichever the preference may be, get ready for the upcoming thrill!",
